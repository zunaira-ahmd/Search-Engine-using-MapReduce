549058,Bumble Bees,Introduction,"


""'''Bumble Bees'''"" (originally called ""Bumble Bee"") is a song recorded by Danish-Norwegian dance-pop group Aqua. It was released as their eleventh single overall and the third from their album ''Aquarius''. The song more closely resembled their earlier releases not possessing the slower beat of ""Turn Back Time"" or the anthemic orchestral features of ""Cartoon Heroes"". The song was released in several European nations in August 2000. It also peaked at number 6 in Denmark and at number 34 in Sweden.

815781,Production coordinator,Introduction,"
A '''production coordinator''' (officially called '''production office coordinator''' and abbreviated '''POC''') is a unionized position in stagecraft under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) and is governed in Los Angeles by Local 871.

The production coordinator serves under the production manager producer  or UPM to coordinate the various groups and personnel that come together in filmmaking to a movie and video production to make a television show. It is a supervisory  position to the Production assistant staff. The position requires adept organizational skills resourcefulness and the ability to handle a  multitude of tasks simultaneously under often high-pressure situations. The POC serves as the gatekeeper of company policy  and is usually responsible for ensuring the rest of the production television crew follows the requirements of the Production Company or Studio.

The duties of a POC are often undefined and extremely varied ranging from office manager to human resources to controller to accountant. The POC is one of the only positions with the IATSE (USA and Canada) which no longer has a scale or set wage. The IA bylaws simply state the POC’s wage is “subject to negotiation with the Producer”. Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plans. Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an ""on-call"" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week no matter how many or few hours they work. Working conditions can vary on the medium (half-hour hour-long television reality live soap and feature) and daily hours can range from 8 to 16 hour days. The POC is often the first person in the office and the last to leave since they hold the responsibility of tending to the needs of the crew. 

More recent attempts have been made by Local 871 to establish a scale rate for the POCs but to date all have been unsuccessful.

The union has a relaxed jurisdiction over the position since it does not have an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC but again since it does not have an official job description in its bylaws many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.

40060,Soviet submarine K-77,Introduction,"







'''''K-77''''' was a ""Project 651"" (also known by its NATO reporting name of ) cruise missile submarine of the Soviet Navy.  Her keel was laid down in the Krasnoye Sormovo shipyard in Gorky on 31 January 1963.  She was launched on 11 March 1965 and commissioned on 31 October 1965 into the Northern Fleet.

''K-77'' was built later in the Juliett class so her hull was conventional steel and her battery was of the conventional lead-acid type rather than the austenitic steel and silver-zinc batteries used in the first Julietts. ''K-77'' was also used as the set for the motion picture ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.

462145,Constructal law,Introduction,"The constructal law was proposed in 1996 as a summary of all design generation and evolution phenomena in nature bio and non-bio. The constructal law represents three steps toward making ""design in nature"" a concept and law-based domain in science:

#Life is flow: all flow systems are living systems the animate and the inanimate.
#Design generation and evolution is a phenomenon of physics.
#Designs have the universal tendency to evolve in a certain direction in time.

The constructal law is proposed as a first principle of physics accounting for all design and evolution in nature. It holds that shape and structure arise to facilitate flow. The designs that happen spontaneously in nature reflect this tendency: they allow entities to flow more easily – to measurably move more current farther and faster per unit of useful energy consumed. Rain drops for example coalesce and move together generating rivulets streams and the mighty river basins of the world because this design allows them to move more easily.

The constructal law asks the question: Why does this design arise at all? Why can't the water just seep through the ground? The constructal law provides this answer: Because the water flows better with design. The constructal law covers the tendency of nature to generate designs to facilitate flow.

359682,Hugh M‘Neile,M‘Neile’s statue,"Following his installation as the Dean of Ripon (on 29 October 1868) M‘Neile made his last speech in Liverpool on 4 November 1868. A group of his friends and parishioners ""having resolved to erect a full-length marble statue of him in Liverpool in commemoration of his many valuable and long-continued services in the cause of religion and religious education"" announced the next day that they were accepting donations to the Statue Fund the maximum contributions to which were fixed at £5.

In May the following year the statue committee announced that its target amount had been reached and that an eminent sculptor George Gammon Adams had been commissioned to produce the work and that Adams had already had several sittings with M‘Neile. The statue was carved from a pure white 8-ton block of Italian Carrara marble (the same marble as Michelangelo's ''David'').

Adams took 18 months to finish the  3-ton statue; and it was finished in mid-October. On 28 October 1870 the Liverpool Council considered a request from the McNeile Statue Committee ""that the statue be accepted for placement in St George’s Hall"" (Cavanagh 1997 p. 281). The suggestion it should place a statue of M‘Neile in such a conspicuous place of honour ""produced an acrimonious discussion""; and given the fierce objections by a considerable number present the subject was deferred for the simple reason that every statue that had been placed in St. George’s Hall up to that time had been accepted by a unanimous vote.

At the next meeting on 9 November 1870 the first chaired by the new Lord Mayor Joseph Gibbons Livingston (who was a strong supporter of M‘Neile) various motions were put various amendments were proposed and a number of very strongly held views were expressed.(1) His entire 34 years in Liverpool had consistently stirred up such ill-will among the classes and such division between different sections of the Liverpool community that any suggestion that he had a national or local claim to such a high honour simply beggared belief; (2) He was a clergyman of high status and pre-eminent in one of the Church’s largest divisions; (3) He had no national significance as a clergyman because he only served the interests of one section of the Church of England; (4) He was an earnest conscientious zealous Christian of the highest principles whose integrity was beyond question; (5) His extreme anti-Catholicism had insulted antagonized and alienated at least a third of the population of Liverpool; (6) His vicious attacks on those who did not share his religious views (Roman Catholics Anglo-Catholics within the Church of England non-Evangelicals non-Conformists and Dissenters etc.) were so offensive that if a statue must be placed in St. George’s Hall it was better to allow considerable time to pass and the offence he had caused to dissipate; and (7) He was a well-published author on divinity and theological subjects and a measure of his excellence was that his works had been reviewed in prestigious publications such as ''The Edinburgh Review'' and ''The Times''. Despite the convention requiring a unanimous vote it seems the majority (the final vote was 36 ""aye"" to 16 ""nay"") were prepared to take the view that whatever divisive conduct M‘Neile may have displayed he deserved recognition as a writer and orator and agreed to place the statue amongst the other eleven local and national dignitaries (Cavanagh 1977).

The established Liverpool custom was a public unveiling with ""the most prestigious guest available invited to officiate"". These were great popular occasions wherein ""extended eulogies were delivered by the succession of committee-members and honoured guests"" reports of which were ""invariably peppered with the parenthetic ""cheers"" ""hear-hears"" ""applause"" and even ""loud and extended applause"" from crowds that attendant reporters frequently emphasized ""encompassed all classes and creeds"" (Cavanagh 1997 p.xvi). Yet in the case of M‘Neile’s statue it was brought to Liverpool and placed on its pedestal in the dark of night and was unveiled ""without any ceremonial"" in St. George's Hall three days later on the evening of Monday 5 December in the presence of the Mayor the chairman secretary and other several members of the Statue Committee several ""ladies"" M‘Neile’s son the Revd Edmund Hugh M‘Neile (who took over St. Paul’s Princes Park from his father) and the Revd Dyson Rycroft Honorary Canon of Liverpool.

Often according to the established Liverpool custom the sculptor would be present; and on occasion the sculptor might even deliver a short speech. In the case of M‘Neile’s statue the sculptor was the only one to speak; and moreover Adams had to unveil M‘Neile’s statue himself.

The final irony is that of all the statues ""the only statue in St George’s Hall to cause offence because of the character of its subject is also the only statue to have received unanimous acclaim as a work of art"" (Cavanagh 1997 p. 282):
::Mr. G.G. Adams the artist who has given us the one good statue in St George’s Hall. … People may quarrel with the objects of the promoters of the memorial but no one can withhold a tribute of admiration to the rare ability of the sculptor. (''Liverpool Daily Post'' 15 December 1870).

140167,Biblical cosmology,Cosmogony (origins of the cosmos),"""The Destruction of Leviathan"" (Gustave Doré 1865)


=== Divine battle vs divine speech ===
Two different models of the process of creation existed in ancient Israel. In the ""logos"" (speech) model God speaks and shapes unresisting dormant matter into effective existence and order (Psalm 33: ""By the word of YHWH the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts; he gathers up the waters like a mound stores the Deep in vaults""); in the second or ""agon"" (struggle) model God does battle with the monsters of the sea at the beginning of the world in order to mark his sovereignty and power. Psalm 74 evokes the agon model: it opens with a lament over God's desertion of his people and their tribulations then asks him to remember his past deeds: ""You it was who smashed Sea with your might who battered the heads of the monsters in the waters; You it was who crushed the heads of Leviathan who left them for food for the denizens of the desert..."" In this world-view the seas are primordial forces of disorder and the work of creation is preceded by a divine combat (or ""theomachy"").

Creation in the ""agon"" model takes the following storyline: (1) God as the divine warrior battles the monsters of chaos who include Sea Death Tannin and Leviathan; (2)  The world of nature joins in the battle and the chaos-monsters are defeated; (3) God is enthroned on a divine mountain surrounded by lesser deities; (4) He speaks and nature brings forth the created world or for the Greeks the cosmos. This myth was taken up in later Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature and projected into the future so that cosmic battle becomes the decisive act at the end of the world's history: thus the Book of Revelation (end of the 1st century CE) tells how after the God's final victory over the sea-monsters New Heavens and New Earth shall be inaugurated in a cosmos in which there will be ""no more sea"" (Revelation 21:1).

The Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1) is the quintessential ""logos"" creation myth. Like the ""agon"" model it begins with darkness and the uncreated primordial ocean: God separates and restrains the waters but he does not create them from nothing. God initiates each creative act with a spoken word (""God said Let there be..."") and finalises it with the giving of a name. Creation by speech is not unique to the Old Testament: it is prominent in some Egyptian traditions. There is however a difference between the Egyptian and Hebrew logos mythologies: in Genesis 1 the divine word of the Elohim is an act of ""making into""; the word of Egyptian creator-god by contrast is an almost magical activation of something inherent in pre-creation: as such it goes beyond the concept of fiat (divine act) to something more like the Logos of the Gospel of John.

=== Naming: God Wisdom Torah and Christ ===
In the ancient world things did not exist until they were named: ""The name of a living being or an object was ... the very essence of what was defined and the pronouncing of a name was to create what was spoken."" The pre-Exilic (before 586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to Yahweh in heaven despite the continued existence of an assembly of subordinate servant-deities who helped make decisions about matters on heaven and earth. The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition (e.g. the Book of Proverbs Song of Songs etc.) develop the idea that Wisdom later identified with Torah existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: ""Present from the beginning Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens restricts the chaotic waters and shapes the mountains and fields."" Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the Epistle to the Colossians calls Jesus ""...image of the invisible God first-born of all creation..."" while the Gospel of John identifies him with the creative word (""In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God"").

135201,Greening Earth Society,Introduction,"The '''Greening Earth Society''' now defunct was a public relations organization which promoted the idea that there is considerable scientific doubt about the effects of climate change and increased levels of carbon dioxide.  The Society published the World Climate Report a newsletter edited by Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute.

It was a non-profit organization created by the Western Fuels Association with which it shared an office and many staff members. It has been called a ""front group created by the coal industry"" and an ""industry front"". Fred Palmer a Society staffer is a registered lobbyist for Peabody Energy a coal company.

Although the Greening Earth Society was generally skeptical of the impact of climate change it acknowledged some degree of global warming as real: ""Fact #1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18°C per decade"".  Note that the actual increase in the global surface temperature during the 100 years ending in 2005 was 0.74 ± 0.18 °C.

471413,Gil Grissom,Creation,"Anthony E. Zuiker who created the show loosely based Grissom on real life Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department criminalist Daniel Holstein. Zuiker was ""fascinated"" by Holstein who like Grissom kept maggots and pig's blood in his refrigerator. Holstein works as a consultant for the show. Zuiker originally named the character Gil Sheinbaum but after he became part of the cast William Petersen requested the name to be changed Petersen and Zuiker decided to rename the character ""Grissom"" after astronaut Gus Grissom of whom Petersen was a great admirer. The name Gil came from one of the actor's hobbies fishing.

In 2000 CBS had bought the pilot script from Zuiker and Nina Tassler CBS's head of drama development passed it on to Petersen who had a pay or play contract with the network. Petersen has said that many TV shows were offered to him over the years but he ""didn't want to get locked down"". However he was impressed with the complexity of Grissom's character and he decided to audition. It was the second time Petersen portrayed a forensic scientist having portrayed Will Graham in the 1986 film ''Manhunter.''

423952,Sig Holding AG,Packaging,"The first packaging machines were produced in 1906 on behalf of the Lausanne-based company SAPAL (Société Anonyme des Plieuses Automatiques).

Most of SIG's earlier packaging equipment efforts were focused on small dry food items such as chocolates and candy. With the acquisition of Doboy Packaging in the U.S. on 28 June 1983 SIG grew its international presence. In 1989 through the acquisition of PKL in Linnich Germany SIG entered the field of aseptic liquid packaging.  This business grew significantly and was later known as SIG Combibloc.

In 2000 SIG concentrated its group focus solely on technology for packaging of food and beverages.  By this time many of their traditional businesses such as arms and Rocktools had been divested.  Management used the resulting cash to procure global businesses including Krupp Kunstofftechnik (Corpoplast/Blowtec/Kautex brands) and HAMBA in Germany; Ryka Blow Molds in Canada; and a substantial portion of the Italian conglomerate SASIB.  The food-related (dry) businesses were organized under the SIG Pack division while the beverage-related (wet) businesses formed SIG Beverages.  Aseptic liquid packaging remained separate under SIG Combibloc.

This strategy while intended to provide common customer bases with turnkey solutions for entire bottling or packaging lines never gained enough momentum to be of any durable competitive advantage. Difficulties integrating vastly different businesses and employee cultures resulted in operational execution issues. In particular high-profile commissioning and installation failures at SIG Beverages in 2003 and 2004 ultimately resulted in erosion of goodwill serious enough to be recorded on financial statements. A refocusing towards primarily aseptics and PET blow-molding resulted in a high number of divestitures and plant closures. The former SASIB wet businesses Simonazzi Alfa and Meyer/Mojonnier were sold to Tetra Laval in 2005 while HAMBA and Kautex/Blowtec went into the hands of separate private investor groups.  The food packaging businesses were sold to Robert Bosch Verpackungstechnik in 2004. The former SASIB dry unit Stewart Systems (bread and bun bakery production lines) was sold to UCA Group in 2004 and subsequently merged with AMF Bakery Systems in 2008.  Laser guided vehicle manufacturer Elettric 80 part of the 1999 SASIB acquisition was sold back to its original Italian owners in 2004.

The considerably slimmed-down SIG Beverages unit focused on machines for PET bottle blow-molding machinery was sold off to the German concern Salzgitter AG in March 2008.  This sale encompassed the subsidiaries Corpoplast Asbofill Plasmax and Moldtec.

Today Combibloc is the last remaining business unit of SIG its sole focus being machinery and materials for aseptic carton packaging.

487220,Kaante,Reception,"''Kaante'' holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes a website that rates films based on published reviews by critics averaging a score of 6.4 out of 10 from 6 reviews. Taran Adarsh of ''Bollywood Hungama'' gave the film three and a half stars out of five and stated ""''Kaante'' takes a step forward in terms of content and technique. An apt example of progressive cinema that breaks the shackles of stereotype the film has everything to woo the cinegoer: an impressive cast grandiose look an excellent second half well executed stunts popular music and eroticism in plenty"". Prem Panicker of ''Rediff'' criticized the film saying ""A more taut script a little less of indulgence in directing a tad more ruthlessness in editing and this film could have pulled off a badly needed box office heist."" A reviewer at ''Sify'' awarded the film three and a half stars out of five and wrote ""A film far ahead of its time in terms of execution ''Kaante'' is a visual delight. And combined with good performances and superb action it's a must-see this season.""

Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised the direction and performances of the lead cast saying ""From the protags’ initial meeting heavy on closeups Gupta directs the film primarily as a character piece with Bachchan Dutt and semi-comic relief Manjrekar driving the drama with richly characterized roles. Shetty a tightly wound actor at the best of times strikes few sparks as the nightclub bouncer and his scenes with Arora as the chanteuse are flat."" Dave Kehr of ''The New York Times'' reviewed the film writing ""A delirious Bollywood reimagining of ''Reservoir Dogs'' complete with musical numbers Sanjay Gupta's ''Kaante'' shifts as fluidly between cinematic idioms as it does between Hindi and English."" Kevin Thomas of the ''Los Angeles Times'' said ""there is a steadfast earnestness in director Sanjay Gupta's deluded attempt to equal or even better Hollywood on its own ground that is rather touching -- but not to the degree that it sustains the film's many tedious stretches.""

249452,Grand tourer,Impact of Racing,"The Italian Mille Miglia thousand-mile race held from 1927 to 1957 was central to the evolution of the ''gran turismo'' concept. The event was one of the most important on the Italian motor-sport calendar and could attract up to five million spectators. Winning drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari Rudolf Caracciola and Stirling Moss; and manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo BMW Ferrari and Porsche would become household names.

According to Enzo Ferrari: ""In my opinion the Mille Miglia was an epoch-making event which told a wonderful story. The Mille Miglia created our cars and the Italian automobile industry. The Mille Miglia permitted the birth of GT or grand touring cars which are now sold all over the world. The Mille Miglia proved that by racing over open roads for 1000 miles there were great technical lessons to be learned by the petrol and oil companies and by brake clutch transmission electrical and lighting component manufacturers fully justifying the old adage that motor racing improves the breed.""The Mille Miglia is still celebrated today as one of the world's premier historic racing events.

A closed sports coupé almost prevailed at Le Mans in 1938 when a Carrozziera Touring-bodied Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B driven by Raymond Sommer and Clemente Bionedetti led the famous 24-hour race from the third lap until early Sunday afternoon retiring only due to engine problems.

Johnny Lurani was impressed by the dominant performance at the Mille Miglia in 1940 by a Carroziera Touring-bodied BMW 328 coupé winning the event at over 100 mph average speed driven by Fritz Huschke von Hanstein and Walter Bäumer:""The BMW team included a splendid aerodynamic ''Berlinetta'' wind tunnel designed by German specialists that was extremely fast at 135 mph... I couldn't believe the speeds these BMWs were capable of.""

===1937–1948 CSAI===
Italy's national governing body of motorsport was the ''Commissione Sportiva Automobilistica Italiana'' (CSAI). Count Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi (popularly known as Johnny Lurani) was a key commissioner. He was also a senior member of the world governing body the ''Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile'' (FIA).

Lurani was instrumental in designing the regulations for the Italian 1937 ''Turismo Nazionale'' championship whereby production vehicles approved by the CSAI were raced with the original chassis and engine layout as specified in the factory catalog and available for customers to buy; engines could be tuned and bored out but the bodywork had to conform to regulations. The CSAI were concerned that FIA (known as AIACR at the time) 'Annexe C' Sports cars were becoming little more than thinly-disguised two-seat Grand Prix racers far removed from the cars ordinary motorists could purchase from the manufacturers' catalogs.

The CSAI was shut down by the Italian Fascist government under Mussolini at the end of 1937 and replaced with a new organisation called FASI. The Italian Fascists as in Nazi Germany sought control of motor racing as an important vehicle for national prestige and propaganda. FASI replaced ''Turismo Nazionale'' with the less strictly regulated ''Sports Nazionale'' championship which ran in 1938 and 1939.

Postwar the CSAI was re-established and in 1947 Italian national championships were held for both ''Sports Internazionale'' (FIA Annexe C sports cars) and ''Sports Nazionale''. ''Sports Nazionale'' was abolished in 1948 creating the opportunity for a new category in 1949.

=== 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa ===
The first race specifically for grand touring motor cars (at the time the regulations designed by Johhny Lurani were actually called ''Turismo Veloce'' or Fast Touring) was the 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa held over three hours on 29 May at the 6.3 kilometer Autodromo Nazionale di Monza (Italy). It was won by a limited production V-12 engined Ferrari 166 ""Inter"" originally known as the ""Sport"" with a coupé body by Carrozzeria Touring of Milan with the Superleggera system.

After this race governing body CSAI officially introduced a new category called ''Gran Turismo Internazionale'' for 1950. The regulations were drawn up by Johhny Lurani and fellow Italian motor racing journalist and organizer Corrado Filippini requiring for qualification the production of thirty models per year thereby ruling out for the time being Ferrari's hand-built ''berlinettas''.  Nonetheless Ferrari 166 (including the upgraded MM - Mille Migila - version) were produced and raced in sports car categories as both open ''barchettas'' and closed ''berlinettas'' including winning the 1950 Mille Miglia outright.

=== 1950 Mille Miglia ===
On the third weekend of April 1950 it was the occasion of the annual Mille Miglia one-thousand miles from Brescia to Rome and back over closed public roads to include a ''Gran Turismo Internazionale'' category for the first time: twenty-four GT cars were entered including Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS Coupé Touring Cisitalia 202B ''berlinetta'' and Fiat 1100 S coupé. The field was rounded out by a solitary Fiat-based SIATA Daina. Alfa Romeo took first place in the ''Gran Turismo'' ''Internazionale'' category (a creditable tenth overall) and also second place in category followed by three Cisitalias. The overall race winning Ferrari 195 S was also a ''gran turismo-''style coupé but in the over 2000 Sports car class—in fact a special 166MM/195S ''Berlinetta Le Mans'' chassis #0026MM famously driven by Giannino Marzotto in a double-breasted suit ""a fitting advertisement for his family's textile business""''.''

=== 1950 Coppa Inter-Europa ===
The 1950 Coppa Inter-Europa at Monza was held in March. Separate races were held for sports cars and for ''Gran Turismo'' cars in four classes: 750 1100 1500 and over 1500.

Ferrari entered and won the Sports car 2000 class with a Ferrari 166 MM ''berlinetta'' while an Alfa Romeo ''Sperimentale'' (over 2000 class) won the sports car race overall.

The ''Gran Turismo'' race was contested by Lancia Aprilia Cisitalia 202B Stanguellini GT 1100 Fiat 500 Alfa Romeo 2500 and Fiat Zagato. The overall winner was WWII fighter ace Franco Bordoni's Maserati A6 1500.

=== 1950 Targa Florio ===
The annual Targa Florio in Sicily was held the first weekend of April and featured a ''Gran Turismo Internazionale'' category for the first time in two classes: 1500 and over 1500. Contested by Lancia Aprilia Cisitalia 202 Fiat 1100 Maserati A6 and even a solitary British Bristol 400 (based on the successful pre-war BMW 328) the ''Gran Turismo Internazionale'' category was won by Argentinian driver Adolfo Schwelm Cruz in an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS.

Schwelm Cruz and Alfa Romeo repeated their success in the 1950 Targa Florio and Mille Miglia by winning the ''Gran Turismo'' category at the Coppa della Toscana in June. An Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 driven by Salvatore Amendola was also victorious in the ''Gran Turismo'' category of the Coppa d' Oro delle Dolomiti in July run through the Dolomite Mountains starting and finishing in the town of Cortina d'Ampezzo.  An Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 took the ''Gran Turismo'' honours again at the Giro delle Calabria in August. The Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 was based on a pre-war design and is considered by some to be the last of the classic Alfa Romeos.

=== 1951 Campionato Gran Turismo Internazionale ===
For 1951 the CSAI organised an Italian national championship for the ''Gran Turismo Internazionale'' category in four classes: 750 1500 2000 and over 2000 cc. Interest was attracted from manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo Lancia Maserati Ferrari Fiat and SIATA.  The championship was held over ten events including all the classic long-distance road races (the Giro di Sicilia the Mille Miglia the Coppa della Toscana the Giro dell'Umbria the Coppa d' Oro delle Dolomiti the Giro delle Calabrie and the Stella Alpina) as well as three circuit races (the Coppa Inter-Europa at Monza the Circuito di Caracalla night-race in Rome and the 6 Ore di Pescara).

=== 1954 FIA Appendix J ===
Prior to 1954 internationally agreed motor-sport regulations existed only for Racing Cars and Sports Cars (FIA Appendix C). After a testy gestation period the FIA introduced for the 1954 motor racing calendar new ""Appendix J"" regulations covering Production Touring Cars tuned Special Touring Cars Gran Turismo Cars and Production Sports Cars. This was the first officially sanctioned international recognition of the Gran Turismo category.

The 1954 Gran Turismo regulations stipulated cars for personal transport with closed bodywork built by the manufacturer of the chassis although open bodies and special coachwork were admissible if listed in the official catalog of the manufacturer of the chassis and if the weight of the car was at least the same as the closed standard model. Minimum production was 100 cars during 12 months and cars needed to have only two seats.

Fittingly Gran Turismo categories (under 1500 and over 1500) were first included in round 3 of the 1954 FIA World Sports Car Championship at the Mille Miglia (the first placed GT being the Lancia Aurelia B20 GT of Serafini and Mancini). GT entries would become a regular feature alongside their Sports Car brethren at international races from this time forward: GTs raced in World Championship rounds at the Targa Florio from 1955 Nürburgring from 1956 Sebring from 1957 Le Mans from 1959 and Buenos Aires from 1960 (from which year every round of the World Championship included GT cars). In 1960 and 1961 an FIA ''Coupé de Grand Tourisme'' (Grand Touring Cup) was awarded.

The FIA Grand Touring category came to be known as ""Group 3"" and is defined in the 1961 Appendix J (English) regulation as: ""Vehicles built in small series for customers who are looking for a better performance and/or a maximum comfort and are not particularly concerned about economy. Such cars shall conform to a model defined in a catalogue and be offered to the customers by the regular Sales Department of the manufacturer.""

=== 1962–1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers ===
In 1962 the FIA addressing concerns to reduce the speeds attained in sports car racing following the disastrous accident at Le Mans in 1955 shifted focus from Appendix C Sports Cars to production based GT cars of Appendix J. The previous World Sportscar Championship title was discontinued being replaced by the International Championship for GT Manufacturers won by the Ferrari 250 GTO in 1962 1963 and 1964.

==== Cobra Ferrari Wars ====
The period 1963–1965 is famous for the ""Cobra Ferrari Wars"" a rivalry between American former-racing driver and Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Le Mans 1959 Aston Martin DBR1/300) and Enzo Ferrari whose 250 GTs were the dominant grand touring cars of the time. Shelby retired from driving due to a heart condition returning to California from Europe in 1959 with the idea to marry the AC Ace sports car chassis with Ford's V-8 small-block engine: the resulting Shelby AC Cobra was a sales success. Like Enzo Shelby sold road cars to support his racing team and like Ferrari the Cobra was a success on the track at least on the short circuits common in the United States. On the longer tracks prevalent in Europe however the Cobra's crude aerodynamics couldn't compete with the sleek 180 mph Ferrari 250 GTOs: even fitted with a hardtop removable roof the Cobra's top speed was 150 mph. At the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans a Cobra placed 7th; Ferraris placed 1st to 6th. Shelby team engineer Pete Brock hand-designed a Kamm-backed aerodynamic body for the Cobra creating the Shelby Daytona Coupe and a showdown with Ferrari was set.

In testing the Shelby Daytona Coupe attained a top speed of 196 mph and went on to win the GT class at the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans. Shelby had beaten Ferrari on the biggest stage however the fast and reliable Ferrari 250 GTOs were again victorious in the 1964 International Championship for GT Manufacturers. The Championship was controversial: Enzo Ferrari with only a narrow points lead over Shelby attempted to have the radical new mid-engined Ferrari LM250 homologated for the final championship round at Monza in Italy. When the FIA turned Ferrari down Ferrari withdrew. The race organisers Auto Club d'Italia fearing a financial disaster from the withdrawal of the famous Italian team cancelled the event and Ferrari was crowned World Champion. In the aftermath Ferrari declared he would never race GTs again and for 1965 the rivalry with Ferrari was taken up by Ford Motor Company and the Ford GT40 also mid-engined in the sports car divisions.

In 1965 with Shelby's race team now dedicated to the GT40 the Daytona Coupes were entrusted to Alan Mann Racing in the United Kingdom and easily won the GT world championship. From 1966 the FIA would return its world championship focus to the sports car division however GT entries would remain an important feature of international sports car racing in the future.

2981,Curry,South Africa,"

African curries Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry the Durban curry bunny chow and roti rolls. The history of South African curries goes back 250 years when the first Indians arrived on the shores of the Natal Colony well before the boom of British curries.

Durban has the largest single population of Indians outside of India who have been developing traditional Natal curries since their arrival. Natal curries are mostly based on South Indian dishes and mostly consist of simple spiced lamb and chicken dishes (with large amounts of ghee and oils) but also include very complex and elaborate seafood chicken and lamb specialties (chicken and prawn curry is a Natal favourite). Continental and British recipes have also evolved alongside Indian South African curries. Continental and British versions use mainly traditional recipes with the addition of red wine milk cream vanilla or butter instead of ghee.

Bunny chow a South African standard has spread in popularity throughout the country and into other southern African countries and countries with large South African immigrant populations. It consists of either lamb chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers. The roti roll is another classic take-away curry that could either be a curry in a very flat roti bread (similar to a kebab bread) or the classic ""chip cheese and curry"" roll which basically consists of fried chips with melted cheese and curry gravy rolled into a roti roll.

323831,Wisconsin and Southern Railroad,Introduction,"

The '''Wisconsin and Southern Railroad'''  is a Class II regional railroad in southern Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois currently operated by Watco Companies. It operates former Chicago Milwaukee St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) and Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (C&NW) trackage mostly acquired by the state of Wisconsin in the 1980s.

Within Wisconsin WSOR connects with four western Class I railroads: BNSF Railway Canadian National Railway Canadian Pacific Railway and Union Pacific Railroad. Through trackage rights over Metra WSOR accesses Chicago to connect with the two eastern Class I railroads CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. WSOR also has access to harbor facilities in Prairie du Chien and transload facilities are located in Milwaukee Janesville Madison and Oshkosh. 22 grain elevators have located rail load-out facilities on the WSOR system.

For train operation purposes the WSOR system is divided into two divisions the Northern Division and the Southern Division. The Northern Division is essentially the original WSOR trackage from 1980 with a few new lines that have been added around the Milwaukee area since the 1990s. It includes the line northwest from Milwaukee to Horicon where it splits into branches to Cambria and Oshkosh as well as a line from Milwaukee north to Kiel. The Southern Division includes the lines acquired from the Wisconsin and Calumet Railroad in 1992 centered on Madison and Janesville as well as several lines acquired in the 1990s in the Madison area. The two divisions are not physically connected with WSOR owned trackage but trackage rights over a short section of Wisconsin Central Ltd. from Waukesha to Slinger provide a link between the two divisions.

WSOR is headquartered in Madison which is also a central hub terminal. The train dispatching office is located in Horicon. Locomotive maintenance is centered in Janesville with secondary work also being performed at Horicon. WSOR's Horicon paint shops perform contract work on both rolling stock and locomotives.

463396,Jack Fingleton,Post-war writing and journalism career,"
After the end of the war Fingleton divided his time between Canberra where until his retirement in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia and cricket journalism. He forged close relationships with several Prime Ministers. In particular Sir Robert Menzies Australia's longest serving Prime Minister provided him with a laudatory foreword in his book ''Masters of Cricket''. Fingleton's Test coverage resulted in a number of books that placed him at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included ''Cricket Crisis'' (mainly an account of the 1932–33 Bodyline series) ''Brightly Fades the Don'' (the 1948 Invincibles tour) ''Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia'' (the English tour of Australia in 1950–51) ''The Ashes Crown the Year'' (the Australian tour of England in 1953) ''Masters of Cricket Four Chukkas to Australia'' (the English tour of Australia in 1958–59) ''The Greatest Test of All'' (the Tied Test of 1960) ''Fingleton on Cricket'' and ''The Immortal Victor Trumper''. His final book the autobiographical ''Batting From Memory'' was to have its Australian launch during the week in which he died of a heart attack. His cricket writing regarded as one of the most stylish by an Australian often left a sour taste with observers because of the persistent anti-Bradman jibes.

During his war years Fingleton decided to take up book writing in addition to newspaper journalism and began compiling a book about the Bodyline series during his spare time in the army a topic that was still deep in the Australian consciousness using his inside knowledge as a participant in that Ashes campaign. As Fingleton had worked for the government's censors he was one of only a few who knew of the effect of the Bodyline controversy in politics as he had been aware of the cables that had been sent by government officials. Fingleton received advice and encouragement from the eminent British cricket writer Neville Cardus and suffered a setback when after finishing half the book he sent his manuscript to be reviewed. It was lost in the post and he had forgotten to make a copy. Fingleton finished his book ''Cricket Crisis'' in 1946 but it was rejected by the publishers Collins who had already published a book by Ray Robinson named ''Between Wickets'' on the same topic. They were also concerned about the marketability of a book that criticised Bradman—still the dominant player of the time and an idolised figure—strongly. Fingleton then published with Cassell and the book was widely acclaimed and is still regarded as the best first-hand account of the Bodyline controversy and of the classic cricket books at large. It was well known for its stylish writing and analytical value. Fingleton expressed his views forthrightly and interspersed the account with analyses and profiles of those involved in the Bodyline series including Bradman Jardine Larwood Warner and McCabe. He criticised Bradman's unorthodox approach in backing away from the bowling and questioned his aloof attitude towards his teammates. This angered Bradman who wrote in his 1949 book ''Farewell to Cricket'' in reply to Fingleton claiming that as Fingleton was an inferior batsman his record gave him ""scarcely...any authority to criticise my methods."" The debate continued on with replies in subsequent publications citing statistics.

As parliament is usually in recess during the summer months Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47 England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling and it was thought that he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton was one of the few who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him most notably all-rounder Keith Miller whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season during the Indian team's tour of Australia Fingleton began his association with ''The Hindu''.

After his death a disused historic scoreboard from the MCG dated to 1901 was taken out of storage and transported to Canberra where it was installed on the top of hill at Manuka Oval and renamed the Jack Fingleton Scoreboard. At the dedication ceremony Governor-General of Australia Sir Ninian Stephen said that Fingleton not merely a Test cricketer who became a parliamentary journalist in the national capital but ""an institution"" in Canberra.

In addition to his writing Fingleton was a witty perceptive and occasionally sardonic commentator for the BBC and at various times a contributor to ''The Times'' ''The Sunday Times'' ''The Observer'' and various newspapers in Australia South Africa and elsewhere. In 1976 he was awarded an OBE for services ""to journalism and to cricket"". He was the subject of three appearances in 1979 and 1980 on Parkinson's TV interview show. Fingleton's judgements were characterised by careful first-hand evidence and was known for sensing the emergence of a possible story. E W Swanton stated that ""Fingleton remains surely as cricket writer and broadcaster the best his country has"".

536287,Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant,Aftermath,"
It cost $186 million to decommission the reactor with the radioactive materials license ending in May 1995.  The low-pressure turbine rotors are currently in use at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station.  LILCO paid Philadelphia Electric Company $50 million to take its fuel to the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant.

In August 2002 a 100 MW Gas Turbine Power Plant was commissioned on the Shoreham site utilizing the existing switchgear that was in place for the decommissioned nuclear facility.  This facility utilizes two 42 MW GE LM6000PC Jet Engine Generators equipped with Sprint injection (can increase capacity to 50 MW each) and Spray Mist Evaporative Cooling (SMEC).

The electric transmission infrastructure has remained connecting it to the Long Island electric grid.  In 2002 the Cross Sound Cable a submarine power cable capable of transmitting 330 MW was laid from the Shoreham plant across Long Island Sound to New Haven Connecticut.  During the Northeast Blackout of 2003 the cable was used to ease the effects of the blackout on Long Island.  After extended negotiations with Connecticut the cable was put into permanent use.

In 2004 the Long Island Power Authority erected two 100-foot 50 kW wind turbines at the Shoreham Energy Center site as part of a renewable-energy program.  At a ceremony chairman Kessel stated ""We stand in the shadow of a modern-day Stonehenge a multibillion-dollar monument to a failed energy policy to formally commission the operation of a renewable energy technology that will harness the power of the wind for the benefit of Long Island's environment.""  The turbines generate 200 MW⋅h per year or 1/35000th of the energy the nuclear plant would have produced.

Had the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station gone into operation as planned it would have prevented the emission of an estimated three million tons of carbon dioxide per year according to journalist Gwyneth Cravens.

A basic goal is to be able to compare measurements made by observers in relative motion. Say we have an observer O  in frame S who has measured the time and space coordinates of an event assigning this event three Cartesian coordinates and the time as measured on his lattice of synchronized clocks  (see '''Fig. 1‑1'''). A second observer O′ in a different frame S′ measures the same event in ''her'' coordinate system and ''her'' lattice of synchronized clocks . Since we are dealing with inertial frames neither observer is under acceleration and a simple set of equations allows us to relate coordinates  to . Given that the two coordinate systems are in standard configuration meaning that they are aligned with parallel  coordinates and that  when  the coordinate transformation is as follows:

Figure 3-1. '''Galilean''' Spacetime and composition of velocities.
Fig. 3-1 illustrates that in Newton's theory time is universal not the velocity of light. Consider the following thought experiment: The red arrow illustrates a train that is moving at 0.4 c with respect to the platform. Within the train a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4 c in the frame of the train. The blue arrow illustrates that a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8 c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.

=== Relativistic composition of velocities ===

Figure 3-2. Relativistic composition of velocities
The composition of velocities is quite different in relativistic spacetime. To reduce the complexity of the equations slightly we introduce a common shorthand for the ratio of the speed of an object relative to light

:

Fig. 3-2a illustrates a red train that is moving forward at a speed given by . From the primed frame of the train a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed given by   where the distance is measured along a line parallel to the red  axis rather than parallel to the black ''x'' axis. What is the composite velocity ''u'' of the bullet relative to the platform as represented by the blue arrow? Referring to Fig. 3‑2b:
#From the platform the composite speed of the bullet is given by . 
#The two yellow triangles are similar because they are right triangles that share a common angle ''α''. In the large yellow triangle the ratio .
#The ratios of corresponding sides of the two yellow triangles are constant so that  = . So  and .
#Substitute the expressions for ''b'' and ''r'' into the expression for ''u'' in step 1 to yield Einstein's formula for the addition of velocities:

::

The relativistic formula for addition of velocities presented above exhibits several important features:
* If  and ''v'' are both very small compared with the speed of light then the product /''c''2 becomes vanishingly small and the overall result becomes indistinguishable from the Galilean formula (Newton's formula) for the addition of velocities: ''u'' =  + ''v''. The Galilean formula is a special case of the relativistic formula applicable to low velocities.
* If  is set equal to ''c'' then the formula yields ''u'' = ''c'' regardless of the starting value of ''v''. The velocity of light is the same for all observers regardless their motions relative to the emitting source.

=== Time dilation and length contraction revisited ===

We had previously discussed in qualitative terms time dilation and length contraction. It is straightforward to obtain quantitative expressions for these effects. Fig. 3‑3 is a composite image containing individual frames taken from two previous animations simplified and relabeled for the purposes of this section.

To reduce the complexity of the equations slightly we see in the literature a variety of different shorthand notations for ''ct'' :

: and  are common.
:One also sees very frequently the use of the convention 

Figure 3-4. Lorentz factor as a function of velocity
In Fig. 3-3a segments ''OA'' and ''OK'' represent equal spacetime intervals. Time dilation is represented by the ratio ''OB''/''OK''. The invariant hyperbola has the equation   where ''k'' = ''OK'' and the red line representing the world line of a particle in motion has the equation ''w'' = ''x''/''β'' = ''xc''/''v''. A bit of algebraic manipulation yields 

The expression involving the square root symbol appears very frequently in relativity and one over the expression is called the Lorentz factor denoted by the Greek letter gamma :
:

We note that if ''v'' is greater than or equal to ''c'' the expression for  becomes physically meaningless implying that ''c'' is the maximum possible speed in nature. Next we note that for any ''v'' greater than zero the Lorentz factor will be greater than one although the shape of the curve is such that for low speeds the Lorentz factor is extremely close to one.

In Fig. 3-3b segments ''OA'' and ''OK'' represent equal spacetime intervals. Length contraction is represented by the ratio ''OB''/''OK''. The invariant hyperbola has the equation  where ''k'' = ''OK'' and the edges of the blue band representing the world lines of the endpoints of a rod in motion have slope 1/''β'' = ''c''/''v''. Event A has coordinates 
(''x'' ''w'') = (''γk'' ''γβk''). Since the tangent line through A and B has the equation ''w'' = (''x'' − ''OB'')/''β'' we have ''γβk'' = (''γk'' − ''OB'')/''β'' and

=== Lorentz transformations ===

'''''Click here for a brief section summary'''''

The Galilean transformations and their consequent commonsense law of addition of velocities work well in our ordinary low-speed world of planes cars and balls. Beginning in the mid-1800s however sensitive scientific instrumentation began finding anomalies that did not fit well with the ordinary addition of velocities.

To transform the coordinates of an event from one frame to another in special relativity we use the Lorentz transformations.

The Lorentz factor appears in the Lorentz transformations:
:

The inverse Lorentz transformations are: 
:

When ''v'' ≪ ''c'' the ''v''2/c2 and ''vx''/''c''2 terms approach zero and the Lorentz transformations approximate to the Galilean transformations.

As noted before when we write    and so forth we most often ''really'' mean   and so forth. Although for brevity we write the Lorentz transformation equations without deltas it should be understood that ''x'' means Δ''x'' etc. We are in general always concerned with the space and time ''differences'' between events.

'''Note on nomenclature:''' Calling one set of transformations the normal Lorentz transformations and the other the inverse transformations is misleading since there is no intrinsic difference between the frames. Different authors call one or the other set of transformations the ""inverse"" set. The forwards and inverse transformations are trivially related to each other since the ''S'' frame can only be moving forwards or reverse with respect to . So inverting the equations simply entails switching the primed and unprimed variables and replacing ''v'' with −''v''.

'''Example:''' Terence and Stella are at an Earth-to-Mars space race. Terence is an official at the starting line  while Stella is a participant. At time  Stella's spaceship accelerates instantaneously to a speed of 0.5 ''c''. The distance from Earth to Mars is 300 light-seconds (about ). Terence observes Stella crossing the finish-line clock at ''t'' = 600.00 s. But Stella observes the time on her ship chronometer to be   = 519.62 s as she passes the finish line and she calculates the distance between the starting and finish lines as measured in her frame to be 259.81 light-seconds (about ).

==== Deriving the Lorentz transformations ====

Figure 3-5. Derivation of Lorentz Transformation
There have been many dozens of derivations of the Lorentz transformations since Einstein's original work in 1905 each with its particular focus. Although Einstein's derivation was based on the invariance of the speed of light there are other physical principles that may serve as starting points. Ultimately these alternative starting points can be considered different expressions of the underlying principle of locality which states that the influence that one particle exerts on another can not be transmitted instantaneously.

The derivation given here and illustrated in Fig. 3‑5 is based on one presented by Bais and makes use of previous results from the Relativistic Composition of Velocities Time Dilation and Length Contraction sections. Event P has coordinates (''w'' ''x'') in the black ""rest system"" and coordinates ( ) in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter ''β'' = ''v''/''c''. How do we determine  and  in terms of ''w'' and ''x''? (Or the other way around of course.)

It is easier at first to derive the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation.
#We start by noting that there can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. ''y'' must equal ''y'' and  must equal ''z'' otherwise whether a fast moving 1 m ball could fit through a 1 m circular hole would depend on the observer. The first postulate of relativity states that all inertial frames are equivalent and transverse expansion/contraction would violate this law.
#From the drawing ''w'' = ''a'' + ''b'' and ''x'' = ''r'' + ''s''
#From previous results using similar triangles we know that ''s''/''a'' = ''b''/''r'' = ''v''/''c'' = ''β''.
#We know that because of time dilation ''a'' = ''γ''
#Substituting equation (4) into ''s''/''a'' = ''β'' yields ''s'' = ''β''.
#Length contraction and similar triangles give us ''r'' =  and ''b'' = ''βr'' = ''βγ''
#Substituting the expressions for ''s'' ''a'' ''r'' and ''b'' into the equations in Step 2 immediately yield
#:
#:

The above equations are alternate expressions for the t and x equations of the inverse Lorentz transformation as can be seen by substituting ''ct'' for ''w''  for  and ''v''/''c'' for ''β''. From the inverse transformation the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for  and .

''Return to Introduction''

==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====
The Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity since ''x'' and ''t'' are obtained as linear combinations of ''x'' and ''t'' with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation namely that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.

A result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially the result is also a Lorentz transformation.

'''Example:''' Terence observes Stella speeding away from him at 0.500 c and he can use the Lorentz transformations with ''β'' = 0.500 to relate Stella's measurements to his own. Stella in her frame observes Ursula traveling away from her at 0.250 c and she can use the Lorentz transformations with ''β'' = 0.250 to relate Ursula's measurements with her own. Because of the linearity of the transformations and the relativistic composition of velocities Terence can use the Lorentz transformations with ''β'' = 0.666 to relate Ursula's measurements with his own.

=== Doppler effect ===

'''''Click here for a brief section summary'''''

The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect) and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line (transverse Doppler effect). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.

==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====
The classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium such as sound waves or water ripples and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source the receiver or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of ''vs'' for a velocity parameter of ''βs'' the wavelength is increased and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by
: 

On the other hand given the scenario where source is stationary and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of ''vr'' for a velocity parameter of ''βr'' the wavelength is ''not'' changed but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by
: 

Figure 3-6. Spacetime diagram of relativistic Doppler effect
Light unlike sound or water ripples does not propagate through a medium and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig. 3‑6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter ''β'' so that the separation between source and receiver at time ''w'' is ''βw''. Because of time dilation ''w = γw''. Since the slope of the green light ray is −1 T = ''w+βw'' = ''γw''(1''+β''). Hence the relativistic Doppler effect is given by
::

''Return to Introduction''

==== Transverse Doppler effect ====
Figure 3-7. Transverse Doppler effect scenarios
Suppose that a source moving in a straight line is at its closest point to the receiver. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless when appropriately defined transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:

In scenario (a) when the source is closest to the receiver the light hitting the receiver actually comes from a direction where the source had been some time back and it has a significant longitudinal component making an analysis from the frame of the receiver tricky. It is easier to make the analysis from S' the frame of the source. The point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time  (i.e. dr/dt = 0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency ''f'' but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame S the receiver is therefore illuminated by blueshifted light of frequency
:

Scenario (b) is best analyzed from S the frame of the receiver. The illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point the light from the source emitted from this closest point is redshifted with frequency
:

Scenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c) the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of  and in (d) the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse however is not true.) Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).

=== Energy and momentum ===

'''''Click here for a brief section summary'''''

==== Extending momentum to four dimensions ====
Figure 3-8. Relativistic spacetime momentum vector
In classical mechanics the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. Linear momentum the product of a particle's mass and velocity is a vector quantity possessing the same direction as the velocity: '''''p''''' = ''m'''v'''''. It is a ''conserved'' quantity meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces its total linear momentum cannot change.

In relativistic mechanics the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector ''(x t)''. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum we start in Fig. 3‑8a by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame the spatial component of the momentum is zero i.e. ''p = 0'' but the time component equals ''mc''.

We can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that ''(mc) = γmc'' and ''p = −βγmc'' since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig. 3‑8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches ''c''.

We will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the four-momentum.

''Return to Introduction''

==== Momentum of light ====
Figure 3-9. Energy and momentum of light in different inertial frames
Light particles or photons travel at the speed of ''c'' the constant that is conventionally known as the ''speed of light''. This statement is not a tautology since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and in appropriate units have equal space and time components for every observer.

A consequence of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum and that their ratio is a constant: ''E/p = c''. Rearranging ''E/c'' = ''p'' and since for photons the space and time components are equal ''E/c'' must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.

Photons travel at the speed of light yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so the mass term in ''γmc'' must be zero meaning that photons are massless particles. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity but ''E/c'' is well-defined.

By this analysis if the energy of a photon equals ''E'' in the rest frame it equals  in a moving frame. This result can by derived by inspection of Fig. 3‑9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.

''Return to Introduction''

==== Mass-energy relationship ====
Consideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several famous conclusions.

*In the low speed limit as ''β'' = ''v/c'' approaches zero  approaches 1 so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum  approaches ''mv'' the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective ''γm'' can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of ''m''. Einstein proposed that the ''relativistic mass'' of an object increases with velocity according to the formula .
*Likewise comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon  so that Einstein arrived at the relationship . Simplified to the case of zero velocity this is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass.

Another way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of  at low velocity:
:  
The second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.

The concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905 ''mrel'' although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles such as electron microscopes old-fashioned color television sets etc.) has nevertheless not proven to be a ''fruitful'' concept in physics in the sense that it is not a concept that has served as a basis for other theoretical development. Relativistic mass for instance plays no role in general relativity.

For this reason as well as for pedagogical concerns most physicists currently prefer a different terminology when referring to the relationship between mass and energy. ""Relativistic mass"" is a deprecated term. The term ""mass"" by itself refers to the rest mass or invariant mass and is equal to the invariant length of the relativistic momentum vector. Expressed as a formula 
: 
This formula applies to all particles massless as well as massive. For massless photons it yields the same relationship that we had earlier established .

''Return to Introduction''

==== Four-momentum ====
Because of the close relationship between mass and energy the four-momentum (also called 4‑momentum) is also called the energy-momentum 4‑vector. Using an uppercase ''P'' to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase '''''p''''' to denote the spatial momentum the four-momentum may be written as
:  or alternatively

=== Conservation laws ===

'''''Click here for a brief section summary'''''

In physics conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915 Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes don't care ''where'' in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum the fact that such processes don't care ''when'' they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy and so on. In this section we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.

==== Total momentum ====
Figure 3-10. Relativistic conservation of momentum
To understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.

In Newtonian mechanics two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: (1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision. (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. For both cases (1) and (2) momentum mass and total energy are conserved. However kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.

In case (2) two masses with momentums  
and  collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass  traveling at the center of mass velocity of the original system . The total momentum  is conserved.

Fig. 3‑10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components ''E1/c'' and ''E2/c'' add up to total ''E/c'' of the resultant vector meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise the space components ''p1'' and ''p2'' add up to form ''p'' of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is as expected a conserved quantity. However the invariant mass of the fused particle given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: .

Looking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable elementary particle spontaneously decays into two lighter particles total energy is conserved but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.

''Return to Introduction''

==== Choice of reference frames ====

The freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems the most convenient frame is usually the ""center-of-momentum frame"" (also called the zero-momentum frame or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig. 3‑11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame however the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.

''Return to Introduction''

==== Energy and momentum conservation ====
In a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since  the momentum . If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.

Conservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that ''p'' = 0 both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis conservation of mass dictates that . In the simplified one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined—an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.

Newtonian momenta calculated as  fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities  is replaced by the highly nonlinear
 so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum or to change the definition of momentum. As we have discussed in the previous section on '''four-momentum''' this second option was what he chose.


The relativistic conservation law for energy and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy momentum and mass. Mass is no longer conserved independently because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy. This makes the relativistic conservation of energy a simpler concept than in nonrelativistic mechanics because the total energy is conserved without any qualifications. Kinetic energy converted into heat or internal potential energy shows up as an increase in mass.

'''Example:''' Because of the equivalence of mass and energy elementary particle masses are customarily stated in energy units where  electron volts. A charged pion is a particle of mass 139.57 MeV (approx. 273 times the electron mass). It is unstable and decays into a muon of mass 105.66 MeV (approx. 207 times the electron mass) and an antineutrino which has an almost negligible mass. The difference between the pion mass and the muon mass is 33.91 MeV.
:  →  +  

Fig. 3‑12a illustrates the energy-momentum diagram for this decay reaction in the rest frame of the pion. Because of its negligible mass a neutrino travels at very nearly the speed of light. The relativistic expression for its energy like that of the photon is  which is also the value of the space component of its momentum. To conserve momentum the muon has the same value of the space component of the neutrino's momentum but in the opposite direction.

Algebraic analyses of the energetics of this decay reaction are available online so Fig. 3‑12b presents instead a graphing calculator solution. The energy of the neutrino is 29.79 MeV and the energy of the muon is  Interestingly most of the energy is carried off by the near-zero-mass neutrino.

39868,Sengoku period,Unification,"
After nearly a century of political instability and warfare Japan was on the verge of unification by Oda Nobunaga who had emerged from obscurity in the province of Owari (present-day Aichi Prefecture) to dominate central Japan when in 1582 Oda was assassinated by one of his generals Akechi Mitsuhide. This in turn provided Toyotomi Hideyoshi who had risen through the ranks from ''ashigaru'' (footsoldier) to become one of Oda's most trusted generals with the opportunity to establish himself as Oda's successor. Toyotomi eventually consolidated his control over the remaining ''daimyōs'' and although he was ineligible for the title of ''Seii Taishogun'' because of his common birth ruled as ''Kampaku'' (Imperial Regent). During his short reign as Kampaku Toyotomi attempted two invasions of Korea. The first spanning from 1592 to 1596 was initially successful but suffered setbacks to end in stalemate; the second begun in 1597 was less successful (as the Koreans and their Ming Chinese allies were prepared for the Japanese the second time around) and ended with Toyotomi's call for retreat from Korea on his deathbed in 1598.

When Toyotomi died in 1598 without leaving a capable successor the country was once again thrust into political turmoil and this time Tokugawa Ieyasu took advantage of the opportunity.

Toyotomi had on his deathbed appointed a group of the most powerful lords in Japan—Tokugawa Maeda Toshiie Ukita Hideie Uesugi Kagekatsu and Mōri Terumoto—to govern as the Council of Five Regents until his infant son Hideyori came of age. An uneasy peace lasted until the death of Maeda in 1599. Thereafter a number of high-ranking figures notably Ishida Mitsunari accused Tokugawa of disloyalty to the Toyotomi regime.

This precipitated a crisis that led to the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 during which Tokugawa and his allies who controlled the east of the country defeated the anti-Tokugawa forces which had control of the west. Generally regarded as the last major conflict of the Sengoku period Tokugawa's victory at Sekigahara effectively marked the end of the Toyotomi regime the last remnants of which were finally destroyed in the Siege of Osaka in 1615.

Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title ''Seii Taishogun'' in 1603 and abdicated in favour of his son Tokugawa Hidetada in 1605 (while retaining real control himself) to emphasize the family's hereditary hold on the post; he thereby established Japan's final shogunate which lasted until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

Kitty Hawk is usually credited as the site of the powered flights because it was the nearest named settlement at the time of the flight; the modern town of Kill Devil Hills did not exist until 50 years after the flights.

98350,Ellison Onizuka,NASA career,"Onizuka was selected for the astronaut program in January 1978 and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979. Later he worked in the experimentation team Orbiter test team and launch support crew at Kennedy Space Center for the STS-1 and STS-2. At NASA he worked on the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test and revision software team.

Onizuka's first space mission took place on January 24 1985 with the launch of mission STS 51-C on Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' the first space shuttle mission for the Department of Defense. He was accompanied by Commander Ken Mattingly Pilot Loren Shriver fellow Mission Specialist James Buchli and Payload Specialist Gary E. Payton. During the mission he was responsible for the activities of the primary payloads which included the unfolding of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) surface. After 48 orbits around the Earth ''Discovery'' landed at Kennedy Space Center on January 27 1985. He had completed a total of 74 hours in space.

Gravesite of Onizuka
Onizuka was assigned to the mission STS 51-L on the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' that took off from Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 EST (16:38:00 UTC) on January 28 1986. The other ''Challenger'' crew members were commander Dick Scobee pilot Michael J. Smith mission specialists Ronald McNair Judith Resnik and payload specialists Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe. It was destroyed when a flame jet leaking from a solid rocket booster ruptured the liquid hydrogen fuel tank 73 seconds after launch. All seven crew members were killed.

Following the ''Challenger'' disaster examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that three of the crew members Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka mission specialist Judith Resnik and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch on the back side of his seat means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However if the cabin had lost pressure the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.

Onizuka was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu Hawaii. At the time of his death he held the rank of lieutenant colonel. Posthumously he was promoted to the rank of colonel.

568649,Left SR uprising,Uprising,"On July 6 shortly after the assassination Lenin ordered Yakov Peters to put under guard the whole Left SR faction of the Fifth Congress of Soviets (approximately 450 people). Bolshoi Theatre where the session of Congress took place was surrounded by chekists and Latvian riflemen. Bolshevik delegates of Congress were allowed to leave the theater while Left SRs were arrested inside the theater.

Blumkin and Andreev drove to the building of a Cheka detachment under the command of Left SR D. I. Popov where at the time the Central Committee of the Left SR party was in session. At about 5:00 p.m. Dzerzhinsky who had been given responsibility for investigating the assassination followed a lead as to the murderers' likely whereabouts and went to the building in order to arrest Blumkin and those who concealed him. But instead of arresting Blumkin Dzerzhinsky himself was arrested by Popov.

The main rebel force was a Cheka detachment commanded by D. I. Popov. Popov's unit was manned by Red Finns and sailors and according to Leon Trotsky's estimate had between eight hundred men and two thousand men several guns machine-guns and armored cars. Trotsky L.  THE REVOLT: Report to the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ Peasants’ Cossacks’ and Red Army Men’s Deputies on July 9 1918 the day following the suppression of the revolt by the Left SRs which took place on July 6–8 1918  Popov ordered to undertake reconnaissance in the streets of Moscow. Group of soldiers from Popov's detachment arrived at Cheka headquarters arrested Martin Latsis and brought him to the building where Popov's unit was located.

For a short time the Left SRs seized the telephone exchange and telegraph office. They sent out several manifestos bulletins and telegrams in the name of the Left S.R. Central Committee declaring that the Left S.R.s had taken over power and that their action had been welcomed by the whole people.

At night Lenin ordered Jukums Vācietis to gather forces to launch an attack against the Left SRs. By the early morning of 7 July the Bolsheviks had gathered enough forces mainly Latvian Riflemen under the command of Vācietis to start an attack. At about 10:00 a.m. they set up their artillery only two hundred yards in front of the building where Popov's unit was located. After an unsuccessful negotiation attempt the Latvians opened fire. The very first salvos hit the Left SR headquarters after which the Left SR Central Committee left the building at once. By about 2:00 p.m. the uprising was crushed and the Left SRs took flight.

A telegram from the Left SR Central Committee stating that the Left SRs had seized power in Moscow was sent to M. A. Muravyov a Left SR and Commander of the Eastern Front. On the pretext of attacking the Germans he seized Simbirsk and tried to march his forces on Moscow in support of the left socialist revolutionaries. However Muravyov could not convince his troops to oppose the Bolsheviks and was killed when arrested.

479250,Lola Albright,Personal life and death,"Albright married and divorced three times having no children of her own. Her first marriage to Cleveland radio announcer Warren Dean occurred in 1944. They divorced in 1949. Her second husband was actor Jack Carson (1951 to 1958). (Another source says that they married August 1 1952 and divorced November 10 1958.) Her third marriage was to Bill Chadney (1961-1975) who played Emmett the piano player on ''Peter Gunn''. They married on May 19 1961; separated around 1967; reconciled then separated again in early 1970 before formally divorcing in 1974.

584080,Polylactic acid,Chemical and physical properties,"Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly-L-lactide ('''PLLA''') is the product resulting from polymerization of LL-lactide (also known as L-lactide). PLLA has a crystallinity of around 37% a glass transition temperature 60–65 °C a melting temperature 173–178 °C and a tensile modulus 2.7–16 GPa.  Heat-resistant PLA can withstand temperatures of 110 °C. PLA is soluble in chlorinated solvents hot benzene tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.

Polylactic acid can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber (for example using conventional melt spinning processes) and film. PLA has similar mechanical properties to PETE polymer but has a significantly lower maximum continuous use temperature. The tensile strength for 3-D printed PLA was previously determined. It was found to range widely depending on printing conditions which were obtained using RepRap 3-D printers. Results of a recent study gave a printed tensile strength of around 50 MPa and show that the act of 3-D printing PLA affects its properties—they showed a strong relationship between tensile strength and percent crystallinity of a 3-D printed sample and a strong relationship between percent crystallinity and the extruder temperature.

The melting temperature of PLLA can be increased by 40–50 °C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60 °C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 1:1 blend is used but even at lower concentrations of 3–10% of PDLA there is still a substantial improvement. In the latter case PDLA acts as a nucleating agent thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA.

There is also poly(L-lactide-''co''-DL-lactide) (PLDLLA) – used as PLDLLA/TCP scaffolds for bone engineering.

749651,Central Catholic Marianist High School,The Holy Bowl,"The annual football game with Holy Cross is known as ""The Holy Bowl.""  Central Catholic leads the series 35-11. First game was played in November 1963 at the old Missions Stadium on a Sunday. Central won that first meeting. The only years that these two teams didn't play were 1974 & 1975 (due to reclassifying the division) and 1994 1995 1996 & 1997 due to the intensity of the rivalry.
Central Catholic VS. Holy Cross in ""The Holy Bowl"" (2013)

""The Holy Bowl"" has been held in almost every stadium in the city. Including the Alamodome (2002-2004).

The ""Holy Bowl"" was usually played as the regular season finale for both schools.  Most often throughout the series the winner claimed not only the ""Holy Bowl"" trophy but also the district title. In 2012 however marked the first time in the history of the series that Central Catholic and Holy Cross met in their season opener. The scheduling changed when Holy Cross was moved from TAPPS 2-I to TAPPS 3-II in the realignment by the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools.

Starting in 2014 ""The Holy Bowl"" will begin its third hiatus due to scheduling conflicts.

After 46 years of competition ""The Holy Bowl"" was the second oldest rivalry in the city.

594596,The I in Team,Plot synopsis,"Willow Anya and Xander are playing three-handed poker since Buffy is elsewhere.  Xander tells his plan to sell supposedly healthy (but nasty tasting) Boost bars.  They question the intentions of The Initiative.  In a field test against the commandos Buffy impresses Professor Walsh.  The next day in the cafeteria Buffy gushes about her performance to Willow.  Willow confirms that The Scooby Gang including Buffy will assemble at The Bronze that night.  Willow obviously misses Buffy who has been rather busy of late.

Giles visits Spike at his new crypt to pay the money he owes from the previous episode in which Spike charged him for his help.  Spike makes it clear that he will not help them again and wants nothing to do with the Scoobies.  Riley takes Buffy into the Initiative.  Professor Walsh gives her a tour of the impressive facility.  Buffy is made a member of the team.  However a slip from Buffy indicating her prior knowledge of the Initiative's behavior modification research (''viz.'' Spike's chip) does not go unnoticed. Tara tries to give a crystal to Willow a family heirloom but Willow refuses to accept the powerful magical implement. Tara invites Willow to try some spells with the crystal that night.  Willow reluctantly declines due to her plans with the Scoobies.  Professor Walsh enters Room 314 in the secure lab area to check up on her special project: a part-demon part-human part robot creature named Adam.

Buffy is an hour late meeting her friends at the Bronze and when she does show she brings Riley and the team.  Buffy reveals that she is now working with the Initiative.  Willow questions how much trust Buffy should put in the organization.  Suddenly Buffy rushes off with the team.  Abandoned by Buffy Willow goes to Tara's dorm room after all.  Buffy and the commandos deploy in two teams in search of a Polgara demon. They are instructed to keep the demon's arms which contain vicious spears intact.

Forrest spots Hostile 17 (Spike) and sends his team after the vampire. Spike gets away but they shoot him with a tracer to be able to track him later.  The Polgara demon attacks the Alpha team; Buffy and Riley fighting together apparently kill it.  Stimulated they have sex (for the first time) in Riley's dorm room. Professor Walsh watches them from a secret camera. Waking up in the morning Buffy is a little surprised to see that Riley is still in bed by her side.  Riley takes a number of pills (""my vitamins"" he says).  They talk but when Buffy asks about ""314"" Riley immediately receives a call from Professor Walsh with an assignment.  Walsh and Dr. Angleman decide that it is time to go with their plan to get rid of Buffy.

Desperate and unable to shake off the commandos Spike goes to Giles for help.  Giles tries to remove the tracer from Spike's shoulder but it's in deep.  Riley reinforces Forrest's team.  With the soldiers gone Walsh summons Buffy for a very easy mission and arms her with a stun rifle.  Wearing a heart monitor and sound camera Buffy goes out alone.  The mission is a trap.  The rifle shorts out the exit is barred and Buffy is set upon by two powerful demons armed with axes.

With Willow doing a masking spell to buy time and Spike babbling from drink in lieu of anesthesia Giles finally manages to remove the tracer from the vampire's shoulder. They flush it down the toilet just in time to misdirect Riley and his team.  Buffy kills the demons but in the fight the monitor falls off.  With no reported heartbeat or movement Walsh assumes that she is dead.  When Riley returns she informs him that Buffy is dead and adds a few more lies.  In the middle of her ""eulogy"" Buffy picks up the camera and reveals in full view of Riley Walsh's trap. Riley walks out on Walsh.  

The Initiative has grafted an arm from the Polgara demon to Adam.  Walsh upset that she had to sacrifice Buffy and Riley's loyalty to safeguard her great project (Adam) goes to Room 314 and speaks as if to the sleeping creature.  Adam wakes and skewers Walsh with his new arm spear saying ""Mommy.""  She falls over dead.

Buffy returns to Giles' place and briefly tells the story.

"
503540,Court of Appeals of Virginia,Panels,"
The Court of Appeals sits en banc (or as a whole) in the following circumstances: 
* Where there is a dissent in a panel to which a case was originally assigned and an aggrieved party requests an en banc hearing and at least three other judges of the Court vote in favor of such a hearing. 
* If a judge of a panel certifies that a decision of that panel conflicts with a previous decision of the Court or of any panel and three other judges agree.
* In any case in which a majority of the Court upon its own motion determines it is appropriate to sit en banc.

Under these conditions the Court of Appeals convenes en banc and reconsiders the case. The court sitting en banc may override any previous decision of a panel or the full Court. No fewer than eight judges may be present when Court of Appeals sits en banc.

409680,The Keep (film),Plot,"Within an uninhabited citadel (the “Keep” of the title) in World War II-era Romania lies entrapped a dangerous demonic entity named Radu Molasar (Michael Carter). The inner walls of the citadel contain 108 T-shaped icons supposedly made of nickel. When the German Army under the command of Capt. Klaus Woermann (Jürgen Prochnow) occupies the castle to control the Dinu Mountain Pass following the commencement of Operation Barbarossa Molasar is unleashed by a pair of looting soldiers who identify one glowing icon as being made of silver. In the ensuing days Molasar kills several soldiers. A detachment of Einsatzkommandos under the command of sadistic SD Sturmbannführer Eric Kaempffer (Gabriel Byrne) then arrives to deal with what is thought to be partisan activity executing villagers as collective punishment.

At the instigation of the local priest the Germans retrieve a Jewish historian Prof. Theodore Cuza (Ian McKellen) from a concentration camp. He deciphers a mysterious message emblazoned on a wall of the citadel. Molasar saves the professor's daughter Eva (Alberta Watson) from sexual assault by two Einsatzkommandos by feeding on their essence and then enlists the aid of her grateful father to escape. Cuza is also cured of his debilitating scleroderma by the touch of Molasar and therefore becomes doubly indebted to the entity who is taking on a solid form. However a mysterious stranger named Glaeken (Scott Glenn) suddenly arrives to foil this plan. After an unsuccessful attempt by the professor to have the stranger stopped the two supernatural beings confront each other. Molasar who is not perturbed by Christian crosses is weakened and drawn back into the innermost recesses. Glaeken is transfixed taking the place of the seal that was broken by the German looters.

297945,Hurricane Donna,Meteorological history,"
On August 29 a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar. That day it is estimated a tropical depression developed along the wave southeast of Cape Verde. There was a lack of data for several days but it is estimated that the system gradually intensified. On September 2 ships in the region suggested there was a tropical storm after reporting winds of over 50 mph (80 km/h). That day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and observed a well-defined eye along with winds of . Based on the data the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan Puerto Rico initiated advisories on Hurricane Donna at 2200 UTC on September 2 about  east of the Lesser Antilles. It is estimated that the storm attained hurricane status a day prior. The Azores High to the north was unusually powerful which caused Donna to move to the west-northwest. When advisories began Donna was a major hurricane which is the equivalent of a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; it would ultimately maintain this status for nine days.

Continuing to the west-northwest Donna strengthened further and on September 4 Donna reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of . After maintaining peak winds for about 12 hours the hurricane weakened slightly as it approached the Lesser Antilles. Late on September 4 the eye of Donna moved over Barbuda Saint Barthélemy Saint Martin and Anguilla and passed just south of Anegada. Despite having weakened Donna remained well-organized described in the Monthly Weather Review as akin to ""an intense idealized hurricane."" A weakening trough to the north turned the hurricane more northwesterly bringing it within  of the north coast of Puerto Rico. By September 7 Donna had turned more to the west after the ridge built to the north. Over the next few days the intense hurricane moved slowly through the southern Bahamas without defined steering currents and the eye passed near or over Mayaguana Acklins Fortune Island and Ragged Island.

While passing through the Straits of Florida Donna brushed the northern coast of Cuba on September 9 with gale-force winds. Subsequently a cold front moved eastward through the United States and weakened the ridge causing the hurricane to turn more to the northwest. It re-intensified over warm sea surface temperatures and the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure dropped to  on September 10. Between 0200 and 0300 UTC that day the  wide eye of Donna crossed through the Florida Keys just northeast of Marathon with sustained winds of  and gusts to . The hurricane continued to the northwest along the southwest coast of Florida passing over Naples and Fort Myers before turning inland to the northeast. At 0800 UTC on September 11 Donna exited Daytona Beach into the western Atlantic with winds of about 105 mph (165 km/h) still as an organized hurricane. Accelerating to the northeast due to an approaching trough the hurricane re-intensified slightly before making landfall near Wilmington North Carolina early on September 12. At 0900 UTC that day Donna again emerged over open waters near Virginia although it had weakened and the eye expanded to over  in diameter. Late on September 12 the hurricane crossed Long Island and later moved through New England. On September 13 Donna became extratropical over northern Maine before entering eastern Canada having become associated with the approaching cold front. After moving across Quebec and Labrador Donna reached the Labrador Sea and dissipated early on September 14.

634227,Ferry Boat Fred,Introduction,"


'''''Ferry Boat Fred''''' was an Australian children's programme which was first broadcast in 1992 on ABC. The main character is a ferry on Sydney Harbour named Fred along with his older sister Kate two other ferries Lou and Bill as well as Jean a really jolly and colourful submarine. There is also the Captain a Koala who is always found asleep behind Fred's wheel (due to koalas finding things very difficult to stay awake all day). Fred has a voluntary deck hand named Pete a ""know-it-all"" Pelican (also best known for his catchphrase ""No Worries!"") who befriends Fred and follows him around the harbour assisting Fred and tying him up at Wallaby Wharf.

The show was a success during its limited run. It was created by Polka Dot Productions a company set up by the Producer/Writer John Pye in 1992 with 25 episodes. John Pye a model maker originally from Dagenham London UK grew up watching the classic British children's TV shows ''Ivor the Engine'' and ''Noggin the Nog'' (made by Oliver Postgate's Smallfilms). Not only did Pye write the scripts and the incidental music but was also responsible for making most of the models. The entire series was filmed by Pye and three friends in a loft in the inner Sydney suburb of Surry Hills. The narrator is Jack Osborn who also provides the voices. A revamp is currently being made as of 2015.

69847,Navassa North Carolina,Environment and biodiversity,"The Navassa and Cape Fear region in southeastern North Carolina is considered an exceptionally rich biodiverse area in the United States. This region hosts 50 different habitat types supporting 300 species of plants and animals. Twenty-two of these species are considered ""endemic"" meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. An assessment of biodiversity was completed by the State and prioritized terrestrial habitats based on the presence and quality of significant natural areas rare species important bird areas high quality wildlife habitat and wetlands. Aquatic habitats were assessed based on aquatic significant natural heritage areas native trout waters anadromous fish spawning areas high quality benthic communities high quality waters outstanding resource waters oyster sanctuaries shellfish harvest areas fish nursery areas submerged aquatic vegetation and stream buffers. Anadromous means that fish are born in fresh water nurseries of Navassa's creeks and rivers spend most of their life in the sea (Atlantic Ocean) and return to the town's fresh waters to spawn.

The Cape Fear River and Brunswick River marshes along Navassa's eastern limits are an extensive  of tidal marshes upstream of saltwater influence. This tidal freshwater marsh is characterized by tall herbs grasses and wildflowers. This site supports the only known population of Carolina Bishop Weed in North Carolina. The natural area has been altered by human influences of ditching diking and roadbed construction. Sturgeon Creek along Navassa's southern limits is a tributary of the Brunswick River and supports the same uncommon natural community type of Tidal Freshwater Marsh. The  marsh contains a population of Cypress Knee Sedge a rare plant species.

Perhaps due to the influence of the flag of the British East India Company the flag of Malaysia is very similar to the flag of the United States albeit the latter has 50 stars in the canton.
As a consequence flags based on the American flag such as the Liberian flag and the Bikini Atoll flag also bear a resemblance to the flag of Malaysia.

Until the spring of 1944 ''George'' escorted transports to the Admiralties the New Hebrides and the Solomons during consolidation operations in the Solomons.  On 16 May she sailed from Florida Island in the Solomons in a hunter-killer group with  and  on what was to become one of the most successful anti-submarine actions in the Pacific war.

During this patrol from 19 to 31 May the three-ship team sank six Japanese submarines (     and ) in waters north of the Bismarck Archipelago.  ''George'' arrived at Manus Island on 4 June after this feat and during the next three months she conducted anti-submarine patrols and escorted merchantmen to the New Hebrides the Solomons and the Marshall Islands.  After serving briefly as station-ship at Funafuti Ellice Islands she steamed to Australia arriving at Sydney on 12 October.

After returning to Purvis Bay Florida Island on 28 October ''George'' resumed anti-submarine patrols and escorted convoys to New Guinea Manus Guam and Saipan.  During the liberation of the Philippines she escorted convoys out of Ulithi and in February 1945 she escorted ships from Guam to Iwo Jima during the invasion and occupation of that embattled island.  In addition she served as air-sea rescue station and on 18 April 1945 she rescued three survivors from a B-29 forced to ditch off Iwo Jima.

During the summer of 1945 she made two escort voyages to Okinawa one each from Ulithi and Guam; and after the Japanese surrender she delivered surrender terms on 12 September to the Japanese garrison stationed on Truk Carolines.  She departed Guam on 18 September and sailed for the United States where she arrived at San Pedro California on 5 October.

307,Atomic orbital,Electron placement and the periodic table," Electron atomic and molecular orbitals. The chart of orbitals ('''left''') is arranged by increasing energy (see Madelung rule). ''Note that atomic orbits are functions of three variables (two angles and the distance  from the nucleus). These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital but not entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.''

Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction



Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''electron configuration''). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the Pauli exclusion principle). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals as well as  or spin quantum number. Thus two electrons may occupy a single orbital so long as they have different values of . However ''only'' two electrons because of their spin can be associated with each orbital.

Additionally an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle but if lower-energy orbitals are available this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a photon) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.

This behavior is responsible for the structure of the periodic table. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods') numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number ''i'' it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the ''i''th shell. Niels Bohr was the first to propose (1923) that the periodicity in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.

The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular 'blocks'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same -state (but the  associated with that -state depends upon the period). For instance the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of Li and Be respectively belong to the 2s subshell and those of Na and Mg to the 3s subshell.

The following is the order for filling the ""subshell"" orbitals which also gives the order of the ""blocks"" in the periodic table:

:'''1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s 5f 6d 7p'''

The ""periodic"" nature of the filling of orbitals as well as emergence of the '''s''' '''p''' '''d''' and '''f''' ""blocks"" is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows (""periods"") in the matrix. Then each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table with each entry representing two successive elements:







1s
2s                                                  2p  2p  2p
3s                                                  3p  3p  3p
4s                              3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p
5s                              4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p
6s  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p
7s  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p




Although this is the general order of orbital filling according to the Madelung rule there are exceptions and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms (see Electron configuration#Atoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule).

The number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the atomic number. The electrons in the outermost shell or ''valence electrons'' tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.

=== Relativistic effects ===


For elements with high atomic number  the effects of relativity become more pronounced and especially so for s electrons which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high- atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.

Examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of mercury (which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding) and the golden color of gold and caesium (which results from narrowing of 6s to 5d transition energy to the point that visible light begins to be absorbed).

In the Bohr Model an  electron has a velocity given by  where  is the atomic number  is the fine-structure constant and  is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics therefore any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the Dirac equation which accounts for relativistic effects the wave function of the electron for atoms with  is oscillatory and unbounded. The significance of element 137 also known as untriseptium was first pointed out by the physicist Richard Feynman. Element 137 is sometimes informally called feynmanium (symbol Fy). However Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of  due to the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than . The critical  value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-positron pairs does not occur until  is about 173. These conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators where such electron-positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed. See Extension of the periodic table beyond the seventh period.

There are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities although individual components of the wave function will have nodes.

5927,Goidelic languages,Influence on other languages,"There are several languages that show Goidelic influence although they are not Goidelic languages themselves.

Shelta language is sometimes thought to be a Goidelic language but is in fact a cant based on Irish and English with a primarily English-based syntax.

The Bungee language in Canada is an English dialect spoken by Métis that was influenced by Orkney English Scots English Cree Ojibwe and Scottish Gaelic.

Beurla Reagaird is a cant spoken by Scottish traveling folk which is to a large extent based on Scottish Gaelic.

English and especially Highland English have numerous words of both Scottish Gaelic and Irish origin.

In ''Predator 2'' the main Predator was designed to look more urban and hip than its predecessor. Design changes included tribal ornamentation on the forehead which was made steeper and shallower brighter skin coloration and a greater number of fangs.  Describing the new Predator's design Stan Winston said ""Broad concept's the same. The difference is this is a different individual. A different individual of the same species. As in a snake is a snake but different snakes are different. Their colorings are different different parts of their characteristics their facial structures subtle differences."" The MPAA initially gave Predator 2 an NC-17 rating so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating.

677313,Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction,Breeding of asexually propagated crops,"Asexual reproduction covers all those modes of multiplication of plants where normal gamete formation and fertilization does not take place making these distinctly different from normal seed production crops. In the absence of sexual reproduction the genetic composition of plant material being multiplied remains essentially the same as its source plant.

Clones of mother plants can be made with the exact genetic composition of the mother plant. Superior plants are selected and propagated vegetatively; the vegetative propagated offspring are used to develop stable varieties without any deterioration due to segregation of gene combinations. This unique characteristic of asexual reproduction helped to develop a number of cultivars of fruits and vegetables including grapes apples pears and peaches.

===Improving asexual plant material through selection===
The selection in these crops is restricted to the material introduced from other sources such as field plantations. The improvement of asexually propagated plants through induced mutations has distinct advantages and limitations. Any vegetative propagule can be treated with mutagens and even a single desirable mutant or a part of a mutated propagule (chimera) can be multiplied as an improved type of the original variety.

===Selection of asexual plants===
Selection in the case of asexual plants can be defined as the selection of the best performing plant and the vegetative propagation thereof. Because plants are not totally genetically stable it can be expected that deviations would occur through the years. Selection is thus an ongoing process where deviants are selected or removed from the selection program. The main purpose of selection is to better the quality and yield of forthcoming plantations. Different approaches can be followed in the selection process of asexual plants such as mass selection and clone selection from clone blocks.

In mass selection there are some factors that must be considered when selecting plants in a mother block e.g. vineyard. Time of selection is a big factor because you have to select when most of the characteristics of the plant are clearly showing. With asexual perennials the best time is just before harvest. For the best results the selected plant must be evaluated during the next season when growth-abnormalities leave disfigurations and virus symptoms are best visualized. Mass selection is done annually on the same plant for a minimum of three years. A plant that does not conform to the requirements in any given year of the selection cycle is discarded from the program.

650445,Burpham Surrey,Sutherland Memorial Park,"In the centre of the village is the '''Sutherland Memorial Park''' a  open space which is a focus of community life in Burpham.  The formal landscaped gardens provide for passive recreation alongside the many sporting facilities offered and an area has been set aside and planted as a wildflower meadow.

The Park was adopted by Guildford Corporation in 1954 after the land was donated by the Duke of Sutherland under a Deed of Gift.  It was given as a dedicated War Memorial in memory of the residents of Burpham who were killed on active service during the Second World War.  Adjoining land was developed and incorporated in the 1990s including a car park.

The Park has won Green Flag Awards in 2004 2005 2006 2014 and 2015 in recognition of it being ""an excellent example of a community park as it addresses the needs and wishes of the local community and current users"".

The multi-use pavilion is home to a local nursery school and provides changing and other facilities for the sports undertaken in the park. There are playgrounds for all ages including a separate toddler area and a basketball court for the teenagers.

Sports facilities include: a cricket pitch (plus practice nets); two 11-a-side and two (junior) 7-a-side football pitches; two pétanque courts; lawn bowls; and a floodlit artificial pitch providing either three tennis courts or two 5-a-side football pitches.

The Park is the home ground of Burpham Football Club who play in the Premier Division of the Surrey Elite Intermediate League.

504605,Jiuyin Zhenjing,Peach Blossom Island,"After Wang Chongyang's death Zhou Botong travelled to Peach Blossom Island where Huang Yaoshi lives to warn Huang not to think about stealing the manual. Huang tricked Zhou into allowing his wife Feng Heng to have a glance at the manual. Feng had eidetic memory and she memorised the text of the second volume after browsing through it once. She lied to Zhou that the manual was worthless by reciting the text and claiming that it came from a book of childish rites she had read before. Zhou believed her and destroyed the book in anger.

Feng wrote the second volume of the manual from memory for her husband fearing that she would forget the manual and miss out on certain parts which Huang would not be glad with as Huang was a martial arts maniac but tragic struck  as Feng in attempt to copy the second volume full rushed days and nights  this was to exhausting for her after giving birth and eventually she died after finishing the manual . Two years later Huang's disciples Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng decided to elope as they fear that their teacher might oppose their relationship. They stole Huang's copy of the manual and fled from Peach Blossom Island. Huang was furious when he found out and he broke the legs of his other four students in anger and banished them from his island. . Huang Yaoshi was filled with grief and he vowed to kill anyone who dared to learn anything from the book that cost the life of his beloved wife.

Meanwhile Zhou Botong realised that he had been fooled by Huang Yaoshi and he returned to Peach Blossom Island to confront Huang. He kept pestering and harassing Huang to hand the book to him. Huang was unable to defeat Zhou and could only imprison the latter on his island by sealing off all exit routes using a formation a formation created by Huang using peach blossom and his knowleage of the Bagua and five elements. As for Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng they started practising the skills in the manual but interpreted wrongly the underlying principles and mastered an unorthodox version of a skill known as the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' (九陰白骨爪). The manual read that the fingers/claw of the person would sink into the fetal points of the enemy they misinterpreted thinking the way to practice this skill requires human sacrifice during practice and hence instils fear in many martial artists by mere mention of its name but the original meaning was to target the fetal points of the human by piecing the users finger into the skull of the enemy and not do this to master the skill. Apart from that the couple also learned the 'Heart Shattering Palm' (摧心掌) and Mei mastered the 'White Boa Whip Skill' (白蟒鞭法). Chen and Mei became known as the ""Twin Killers in the Dark Wind"" for using those skills to commit heinous crimes and terrorise the ''jianghu''. In the process of learning these skills they did not have sufficient inner energy and hence rushed the process of cultivating a strong inner energy by eating arsenic and forcing it out of their body. Arsenic was the most commonly known strongest poison in ancient Chinese.

The couple settled in Mongolia to avoid pursuit from their enemies in China. They met Guo Jing and the ""Seven Freaks of Jiangnan"" and engaged in a fierce battle. Chen was stabbed and killed by Guo for underestimating Guo as a child while Mei was blinded by Ke Zhen'e's poison darts but she managed to flee with her husband's dead body. As Chen had tattooed the text of the manual on his chest Mei skins her dead husband and takes the grisly text with her. She later meets Yang Kang who offers her shelter in an underground room in his house and she teaches him the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' in return.

__NOTOC__
The year '''500 BC''' was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Camerinus and Longus''' (or less frequently '''year 254 '' Ab urbe condita'''''). The denomination 500 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

205908,NBA Live (video game series),''NBA Live'',"===History===
In the fall of 1994 the annual EA basketball release received a simpler title of ''NBA Live 95''.  This naming pattern using the forthcoming year has continued except for varying to use of all 4 digits of the year from ''2000'' to ''2005''.   Each version's initial release was in the fall near the start of the NBA campaign though additional ports were sometimes delayed until as late as January or February.  After 16 consecutive seasons of releases an effort to retool the game as ''NBA Elite 11'' met with development troubles and put the game on hiatus for three years.  The series returned with ''NBA Live 14'' in November 2013.

The pioneer ''NBA Live 95'' release was for fourth generation video game systems Sega Genesis and SNES as well as the MS-DOS operating system.  ''NBA Live 96'' included the first fifth generation version with the PlayStation and also the first handheld games version on the Game Boy. Sixth generation production started with ''NBA Live 2001'' and continued all the way through ''NBA Live 2009'' on the high selling ''PlayStation 2''.  ''NBA Live 06'' was the first to hit seventh generation consoles after its release to the Xbox 360.  Finally with the release of ''NBA Live 14'' for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 EA continued its run on into eighth generation machines.  The game was released on PC each season until support was pulled after the ''NBA Live 08'' season.

The Create-A-Player feature was not available in the 1995 versions of the game but has been a mainstay since ''NBA Live 96.

''NBA Live 99'' was the first to feature Practice Mode and Multi-season play.

Starting in ''NBA Live 2000'' the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Through the series some of the Legend rosters were changed for various reasons. Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004 before being removed due to licensing in later versions.  Spud Webb Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tom Chambers were added to the rosters in ''NBA Live 06''.

''NBA Live 2005'' brought the addition of the Freestyle Air NBA All-Star Weekend which includes the Rookie Challenge Three Point Shootout Slam Dunk Contest and the NBA All-Star Game and Freestyle Challenge which 2 players or more can play the Three Point Shootout or the Slam Dunk Contest.

In ''NBA Live 08'' a limited number of international teams were added under FIBA's license.

''NBA Live 09'' added a feature called Dynamic DNA the first concept of daily updates changing tendencies rosters and hot-cold streaks.

After the release of ''NBA Live 10'' EA attempted to retool the series under a new name with ''NBA Elite 11''. However the game was met with bad publicity and development problems before release and was cancelled (though a playable demo was released for download and several copies of the full release found their way to customers). In November 2010 development of the franchise was moved from EA Canada studio to Florida-based Tiburon studio. It was eventually announced that the series' next installment would be released in Fall 2012 and would return to the ''NBA Live'' name as ''NBA Live 13'' but it would later be announced on September 27 2012 that they would cancel the release. It wasn't until the fall of 2013 that the next game ''NBA Live 14'' would be released. ''NBA Live 16'' was released on September 29 2015. NBA Live Mobile was released on July 6 2016 and it is currently the latest of the NBA Live series. ''NBA Live 18'' is set for a September 15 2017 release and will feature players of the WNBA.

The '''Hymenolepididae''' are family of cyclophyllid tapeworms.  Their characteristic feature is the small number of testes (one to four).  The unilateral genital pores and large external seminal vesicle allow for easy recognition.  Most species are small transparent and easy to study. The family contains over 90 genera with over 900 species having as their definitive host birds (c. 700 species) or mammals (about 250 species). Most reside in the intestines of their definitive hosts. The majority of species with known lifecycles have arthropods as intermediate hosts.

113311,Finnish Orthodox Church,Structure and organization,"Uspenski Cathedral in Helsinki.
The St. Nicholas Church in Vaasa (1862).
Along with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland the Orthodox Church of Finland has a special position in Finnish law. The church is considered to be a Finnish entity of public nature. The external form of the church is regulated by an Act of Parliament while the spiritual and doctrinal matters of the church are legislated by the central synod of the church. The church has the right to tax its members and corporations owned by its members. Previously under the Russian Orthodox Church it has been an autonomous Orthodox archdiocese of the Patriarchate of Constantinople since 1923.

The wooden Orthodox church of Tornio (1884).
The Finnish Orthodox Church is divided into three dioceses (''hiippakunta'') each with a subdivision of parishes (''seurakunta''). There are 21 parishes with 140 priests and more than 58000 members in total. The number of church members has been steadily growing for several years. A convent and a monastery also operate within the church.

Another St. Nicholas Church in Joensuu (1887) perhaps the most impressive wooden Orthodox church in Finland.
The central legislative organ of the church is the central synod which is formed of
*bishops and coadjutor bishops
*eleven priests
*three cantors
*eighteen laymen and -women
The priests and cantors elect their representatives on diocesan basis using plurality election method. The laymen representatives are elected indirectly. The nominations for representatives are made by the parish councils which also elect the electors who then elect the lay representatives to the central synod. The central synod elects the bishops and is responsible for the economy and the general doctrine of the church.


The two executive bodies of the church central administration are the synod of bishops responsible for the doctrinal and foreign affairs of the church and the church administrative council (''kirkollishallitus'') responsible for day-to-day management of the church.

The parishes are governed by the rector and the parish council which is elected in a secret election. All full-age members of the parish are eligible to vote and to be elected to the parish council. The members of the parish have the right to refrain from being elected to a position of trust of the parish only if they are over 60 years of age or have served at least eight years in a position of trust. The parish council elects the parish board which is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the parish.

Financially the church is independent of the state budget. The parishes are financed by the taxes paid by their members. The central administration is financed through the contributions of the parishes. The central synod decides yearly the amount of contributions the parishes are required to make.

A contemporary Orthodox church in Tapiola Espoo (1998).
The special status of the Orthodox church is most visible in the administrative processes. The church is required to conform with the general administrative law and the decisions of its bodies may be appealed against in the regional administrative courts. However the court is limited to reviewing the formal legality of the decision. It may not overturn an ecclesiastical decision on the basis of its unreasonableness. The decisions of the synod of bishops and the central synod are not subject to the oversight of the administrative courts. In contrast similar legal oversight of private religious communities is pursued by the district courts.

Finnish law protects the absolute priest–penitent privilege. A bishop priest or deacon of the Church may not divulge information he has heard during confession or spiritual care. The identity of the sinner may not be revealed for any purpose. However if the priest hears about a crime that is about to be committed he is responsible for informing the authorities in such manner that privilege is not endangered.

In addition to land mobile use waterproof walkie talkie designs are also used for marine VHF and aviation communications especially on smaller boats and ultralight aircraft where mounting a fixed radio might be impractical or expensive. Often such units will have switches to provide quick access to emergency and information channels.

Intrinsically safe walkie-talkies are often required in heavy industrial settings where the radio may be used around flammable vapors.  This designation means that the knobs and switches in the radio are engineered to avoid producing sparks as they are operated.

473144,Fijación Oral Vol. 1,Introduction,"



'''''Fijación Oral Vol. 1''''' () is the sixth studio album by Colombian singer and songwriter Shakira. It was released on 3 June 2005 by Epic Records. After attaining international success in 2001 with her first English record ''Laundry Service'' Shakira wanted to release a fifth Spanish-language project as its followup. In the vein of her earlier work ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' is a Latin pop album. Shakira enlisted Rick Rubin as executive producer also working with Gustavo Cerati Lester Mendez Luis Fernando Ochoa and Jose ""Gocho"" Torres.

At its release ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' received generally favorable reviews from music critics who complimented Shakira's evolution from her earlier work. The album debuted at number four on the US ''Billboard'' 200 with first-week sales of 157000 copies. It set a record as the highest debut for a full-length Spanish-language album in the country which still stands. Internationally the album topped the charts in Argentina Germany Mexico and Spain. ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' was the Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards and the Album of the Year and the Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' became the highest selling Latin pop album of the decade in the United States and the second highest selling Latin album overall. As of May 2013 over four million copies of the album were sold worldwide and it is one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States.

Four singles were released to promote the album. Although its lead single (""La Tortura"") was the only track to reach the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 the follow-up singles ""No"" ""Día de Enero"" and ""Las de la Intuición"" enjoyed moderate success on the Hot Latin Songs Tropical Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts. In November 2005 Shakira supplemented the album with her second English-language record ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2''. The two were packaged together as a box set and released as ''Oral Fixation Vol. 1 & 2'' in January 2007. The projects were promoted with the Oral Fixation Tour in 2006 and 2007 which visited the Americas Africa Asia and Europe. A performance in Miami Florida was filmed and released as a live album in November 2007.

There are no crayfish native to continental Africa but seven species on Madagascar all of the genus ''Astacoides''.

Australasia is particularly rich in crayfish. The small genus ''Paranephrops'' is endemic to New Zealand. Two genera ''Astacopsis'' and ''Parastacoides'' are endemic to Tasmania while a further two are found on either side of the Bass Strait – ''Geocharax'' and ''Engaeus''. The greatest diversity however is found on the Australian mainland. Three genera are endemic and have restricted distributions (''Engaewa'' ''Gramastacus'' and ''Tenuibranchiurus'') while two are more widespread and contain more than one hundred species between them: ''Euastacus'' around the Australian coast from Melbourne to Brisbane and ''Cherax'' across Australia and New Guinea.

Hunold appears to have known Bach and in Halle he wrote texts for Bach cantatas which were performed at the court of Leopold Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. With the partial exception of ''Lobet den Herrn alle seine Heerscharen'' BWV Anh. 5 which uses religious themes these were secular works written especially for occasions such as birthdays.  This collaboration between Bach and Hunold lasted from 1718 to 1720 after which year the composer found another librettist for his continuing series of congratulatory cantatas.
After the poet had died Bach returned to his work as the basis for the cantata ''Ich bin in mir vergnügt''.

474643,Jetfire,Transformers: Prime,"
Jetfire is a member of the Aerialbots but does not seem to make up any part of Superion. He was formerly a neutral Scientist until Starscream betrayed him and joined the Decepticons; in retaliation Jetfire joined the Autobots.

===Books===
Jetfire appears in the novels ''Transformers: Exodus'' and ''Transformers: Retribution''. A former Seeker Jetfire chooses to side with the Autobots rather than joining the Decepticons along with most of his fellow Seekers and becomes one of a handful of Autobots who are flight capable. He proves to be a valuable asset and remains behind on Cybertron to aid the Wreckers when the ''Ark'' departs. Despite his valiant efforts some Autobots-notably Wheeljack-continued to doubt his loyalty and suspected that he was a double-agent for the Decepticons. Jetfire proved his loyalty by joining a mission under Ultra Magnus to rescue Alpha Trion from Shockwave.

===Games===
Jetfire is one of the playable Autobots in the 2010 video game ''Transformers: War for Cybertron'' and speaks with an  Australian accent (similar to his ''Cybertron'' and film incarnations). In the Decepticon campaign he starts out as one of Starscream's partners in charge of guarding the dark energon. He also tries to warn Megatron about the deadly effects of dark energon but his cries fall on deaf ears as the Decepticon leader immerses himself in it becoming more powerful. After that Starscream turns his allegiance to Megatron. Jetfire fled the scene.

In the Autobot campaign Jetfire joins Air Raid and Silverbolt in flying in orbit of Cybertron to take down the armed Decepticon orbital station Trypticon which is preventing Autobot transport ships from leaving the dying planet. The aerial trio enter Trypticon and destroy his cooling systems and plasma reactor disabling his main weapon. Unfortunately the attacks are not enough to disable Trypticon so they enter his core and destroy his transformation cog forcing him to revert into his true form. Forced to transform into dinosaur mode Trypticon sets a course toward the Autobot city of Iacon with the intent of decimating it but the Autobot trio destroy his flight pack sending him crashing into the planet. This leaves Optimus Prime and his ground-based team with the task of finishing off Trypticon before he lays further waste on Iacon.

Jetfire is playable in the last level of ''Transformers: Fall of Cybertron''. The player's mission as Jetfire is to destroy the Decepticon tow cables.

132193,Corazon Aquino,Introduction,"





'''Maria Corazon''' ""'''Cory'''"" '''Cojuangco Aquino''' (''née'' '''Sumulong'''; January 25 1933 – August 1 2009) was a Filipina politician who served as the 11th President of the Philippines and the first woman to hold that office. She was the first democratically-elected president since Diosdado Macapagal left office in 1965 and the first female president in Asia. Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution which toppled the 21-year authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and restored democracy to the Philippines. She was named ''Time'' magazine's ""Woman of the Year"" in 1986. Prior to this she had not held any other elective office.

A self-proclaimed ""plain housewife"" she was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. the staunchest critic of President Marcos. She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband was assassinated on August 21 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States. In late 1985 Marcos called for snap elections and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her Vice-President. After the elections were held on February 7 1986 the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners amidst allegations of electoral fraud with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions. Defections from the Armed Forces and the support of the local Catholic hierarchy led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on February 25 1986.

As President Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the 1987 Constitution which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress. Her administration gave strong emphasis and concern for civil liberties and human rights and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing Communist insurgency and Islamist secession movements. Her economic policies centred on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy.

Aquino faced several coup attempts against her government and various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as President by Fidel V. Ramos and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues.

In 2008 Aquino was diagnosed with colorectal cancer from which she died on August 1 2009. Her son Benigno Aquino III was President of the Philippines from June 30 2010 to June 30 2016. Throughout her life Aquino was known to be a devout Roman Catholic and was fluent in French Japanese and English aside from her native Tagalog and Kapampangan.

30881,Anne McCaffrey,Life and career,"
Anne Inez McCaffrey was born in Cambridge Massachusetts the second of three children of Anne Dorothy (née McElroy) and Col. George Herbert McCaffrey. She had two brothers: Hugh (""Mac"" died 1988) and Kevin Richard McCaffrey (""Kevie""). Her father had Irish and English ancestry and her mother was of Irish descent. She attended Stuart Hall (a girls' boarding school in Staunton Virginia) and graduated from Montclair High School in New Jersey. In 1947 she graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College with a degree in Slavonic languages and Literature.

In 1950 she married Horace Wright Johnson (died 2009) who shared her interests in music opera and ballet. They had three children: Alec Anthony born 1952; Todd born 1956; and Georgeanne (""Gigi"" Georgeanne Kennedy) born 1959.

Except for a short time in Düsseldorf the family lived for most of a decade in Wilmington Delaware. They moved to Sea Cliff Long Island in 1965 and McCaffrey became a full-time writer.

McCaffrey served a term as secretary-treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1968 to 1970. In addition to handcrafting the Nebula Award trophies her responsibilities included production of two monthly newsletters and their distribution by mail to the membership.

McCaffrey immigrated to Ireland with her two younger children in 1970 weeks after filing for divorce. Ireland had recently exempted resident artists from income taxes an opportunity that fellow science-fiction author Harry Harrison had promptly taken and helped to promote. McCaffrey's mother soon joined the family in Dublin. The following spring McCaffrey was guest of honour at her first British science-fiction convention (Eastercon 22 1971). There she met British reproductive biologist Jack Cohen who would be a consultant on the science of Pern.

=== Writer ===
McCaffrey had had two short stories published during the 1950s. The first (""Freedom of the Race"" about women impregnated by aliens) was written in 1952 when she was pregnant with her son Alec. It earned a $100 prize in ''Science-Fiction Plus''. Her second story ""The Lady in the Tower"" was published in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' by editor Robert P. Mills and published again by editor Judith Merril for ''The Year's Greatest Science Fiction''. McCaffrey said ""she thought of the story when wishing herself alone like a lady in an ivory tower"".

Judith Merril matched McCaffrey with her long-time literary agent Virginia Kidd (died 2003) and invited her to the Milford Writer's Workshop (to which she returned many times) where participants each brought a story to be critiqued. After her first Milford workshop in 1959 she worked on ""The Ship Who Sang"" the story which began the Brain & Brawn Ship series. At the story's end the spaceship Helva sings ""Taps"" for her human partner. Decades later McCaffrey's son Todd called it ""almost an elegy to her father"". In interviews between 1994 and 2004 she considered it her best story and her favourite. ""I put much of myself into it: myself and the troubles I had in accepting my father's death 1954 and a troubled marriage.""

McCaffrey then wrote two more ""Ship"" stories and began her first novel. Regarding her motivation for ''Restoree'' (1967) her son recalled her saying ""I was so ''tired'' of all the weak women screaming in the corner while their boyfriends were beating off the aliens. I wouldn't have been—I'd've been in there swinging with something or kicking them as hard as I could"". McCaffrey explained that it did not require a sequel; it ""served its purpose of an intelligent survivor-type woman as the protagonist of an s-f story"".

Regarding her 1969 ''Decision at Doona'' (which she dedicated ""To Todd Johnson—of course!"") her son recalled that he was directed to lower his voice in his fourth-grade school play when his mother was in the auditorium. That inspired the Doona story which opens on ""an overcrowded planet where just talking too loud made you a social outcast"". As a settler on Doona the boy talker has a priceless talent.

McCaffrey made a fast start in Ireland completing for 1971 publication ''Dragonquest'' and two Gothic novels for Dell ''The Mark of Merlin'' and ''The Ring of Fear''. With a contract for ''The White Dragon'' (which would complete the ""original trilogy"" with Ballantine) her writing stalled. During the next few years the family moved several times in the Dublin area and struggled to make ends meet supported largely by child-care payments and meager royalties.

The young-adult book market provided a crucial opportunity. Editor Roger Elwood sought short contributions for anthologies and McCaffrey started the Pern story of Menolly. She delivered ""The Smallest Dragonboy"" for $154 and four stories which later became ''The Crystal Singer''. Futura Publications in London signed her to write books about dinosaurs for children. Editor Jean E. Karl at Atheneum Books sought to attract more female readers to science fiction and solicited ""a story for young women in a different part of Pern"". McCaffrey completed Menolly's story as ''Dragonsong'' and contracted for a sequel before its publication in 1976.
The tales of Menolly are continued in ''Dragonsinger: Harper of Pern'' and ''Dragondrums'' as the ""Harper Hall Trilogy"".  With a contract with Atheneum she was able to buy a home (named ""Dragonhold"" for the dragons who bought it). Her son wrote 20 years later that she ""first set dragons free on Pern and then was herself freed by her dragons.""

=== Dragons ===
The first Pern story ""Weyr Search"" was published in 1967 by John W. Campbell in ''Analog Science Fiction and Fact''. It won the 1968 Hugo Award for best novella voted by participants in the annual World Science Fiction Convention. The second Pern story ""Dragonrider"" won the 1969 Nebula Award for best novella voted annually by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Thus she was the first woman to win a Hugo for fiction and the first to win a Nebula.

""Weyr Search"" covers the recruitment of a young woman Lessa to establish a telepathic bond with a queen dragon at its hatching thus becoming a dragonrider and the leader of a Weyr community. ""Dragonrider"" explores the growth of the queen dragon Ramoth and the training of Lessa and Ramoth. Editor Campbell requested ""to see dragons fighting thread the menace from space"" and also suggested time travel; McCaffrey incorporated both suggestions. The third story ""Crack Dust Black Dust"" was not separately published but the first Pern novel (''Dragonflight'' published by Ballantine Books in 1968) was a fix-up of all three.


Agent Virginia Kidd and editor Betty Ballantine provided advice and assistance for its sequel ''Dragonquest''. It was almost complete (and the contract for another sequel signed) before the 1970 move to Ireland. Both Ballantine and fellow writer Andre Norton made suggestions for the mutant white dragon.

Readers waited a long time for the completion of the original trilogy. Progress was not made until 1974–1975 when the New England Science Fiction Association invited McCaffrey to its annual convention (Boskone) as guest of honour (which included publication of a novella for sale on-site). She wrote ''A Time When'' which would become the first part of ''The White Dragon''.

''The White Dragon'' was released with new editions of the first two Pern books with cover art illustrated by Michael Whelan. It was the first science-fiction book by a woman on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list and the cover painting is still in print from Whelan. The artists share credit for their career breakthroughs.

=== Collaborations ===
McCaffrey said of her collaborations with son Todd McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough ""While I would dearly love to have the energy to tell a tale all on my own I really cannot say that I am not ably represented with my collaborations"". In the Pern collaboration with Todd she was mainly ""making suggestions or being a sounding board"". According to Todd McCaffrey also gave Todd and his sister Gigi permission to write their own stories set in the Pern universe.

=== Death ===
McCaffrey died at age 85 on 21 November 2011 at her home in Ireland following a stroke.

440503,Fernery,Introduction,"A '''fernery''' is a specialized garden for the cultivation and display of ferns.
A fernery at the Geelong Botanic Gardens (1892-1902).
In many countries ferneries are indoors or at least sheltered or kept in a shadehouse to provide a moist environment filtered light and protection from frost and other extremes; on the other hand some ferns native to arid regions require protection from rain and humid conditions and grow best in full sun. In mild climates ferneries are often outside and have an array of different species that grow under similar conditions.

In 1855 parts of England were gripped by ‘pteridomania’ (the fern craze). This term was coined by Charles Kingsley clergyman naturalist (and later author of The Water Babies). It involved both British and exotic varieties being collected and displayed; many associated structures were constructed and paraphernalia was used to maintain the collections.

In 1859 the Fernery at Tatton Park Gardens beside Tatton Hall had been built to a design by George Stokes Joseph Paxton's assistant and son-in-law to the west of the conservatory to house tree ferns from New Zealand and a collection of other ferns. The Fernery was also seen in the TV miniseries Brideshead Revisited.

In 1874 the fernery in Benmore Botanic Garden(part of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh) was built by James Duncan (a plant collector and sugar refiner). This was a large and expensive project since the fernery was based in a heated conservatory. In 1992 it was listed Historic Scotland for its architectural and botanical value and has been described by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland as “extremely rare and unique in its design”.

In 1903 Hever Castle in Kent was acquired and restored by the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor who used it as a family residence. He added the Italian Garden (including a fernery) to display his collection of statuary and ornaments.

625955,Hylton v. United States,Introduction,"


'''''Hylton v. United States'''''  is an early United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a yearly tax on carriages did not violate the Article I Section 2 Clause 3 and Article I Section 9 Clause 3 requirements for the apportioning of direct taxes. The Court concluded that the carriage tax was not a direct tax requiring apportionment among the states by population. The Court noted that a tax on land was an example of a direct tax contemplated by the Constitution.

The case is also significant for being the first case by the Supreme Court to rely on judicial review later formally established by ''Marbury v. Madison'' (1803) in order to decide whether a statute of Congress was unconstitutional.

205714,Tony Soprano,Fictional character biography,"
=== Early life ===
Tony Soprano was born in 1959 to Livia and Johnny Soprano. His father was a ''capo'' in the DiMeo crime family. He grew up living with his parents and two sisters Janice and Barbara in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark New Jersey. Tony's paternal grandfather Corrado Soprano Sr. was an Italian immigrant and master stonemason who helped to build a church in Tony's old neighborhood.

In adulthood Tony recalled how Johnny used Janice as a cover for attending meetings with criminal associates at a children's amusement park leading him to assume she was his father's favorite child. In therapy when asked to remember happy childhood memories about his mother Tony struggles to come up with any; he later describes his mother as a cruel joyless woman who wore his father down ""to a little nub"". Tony has a troubled relationship with Janice because she is always asking him for money and once tried to sell Livia's house by herself. Tony also was forced to dispose of the body of Janice's re-acquainted boyfriend Richie Aprile after she killed him.

In high school Tony met his future bride Carmela DeAngelis and became friends with Artie Bucco and Davey Scatino. He was also close to his cousin Tony ""Tony B"" Blundetto and their mutual relatives called them Tony-Uncle-Al and Tony-Uncle-Johnny (after their fathers) to tell them apart. The two Tonys spent summers at the farm of their uncle Pat Blundetto a DiMeo ''soldato'' (soldier). Tony B was arrested for his part in a hijacking when the two Tonys were young men. Tony was supposed to join Tony B on the job but failed to appear because of a panic attack after an argument with his mother. At the time he told people he had been attacked and injured by black gangsters. He attended Seton Hall University for a semester and a half before dropping out to pursue a life of crime.

Tony was part of an unofficial crew of young criminals consisting of Silvio Dante Ralph Cifaretto and Jackie Aprile Sr. He  and Jackie gained notoriety in the DiMeo family by robbing a card game run by Feech La Manna. He committed his first murder in 1982 at the age of 22 killing a small-time bookie named Willie Overall. In season one Tony states that he knew real-life Mafia boss John Gotti in the 1980s.

Johnny shepherded Tony through his ascendancy until his death in 1986 from emphysema. When he died Johnny had risen to the level of ''capo'' of his own crew as had his older brother Junior. Junior took over as Tony's mentor and parental figure Salvatore ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero and Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gualtieri passed their loyalty to Tony upon Johnny's death while Silvio joined the crew. Tony became acting ''capo'' of his father's old crew a position which eventually became permanent.

By 1995 Jackie Aprile Sr. became acting boss after Ercole ""Eckley"" DiMeo was sent to prison. The DiMeo family was prosperous under Jackie's rule until 1998 when he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. With Jackie in and out of the hospital a power struggle developed between Tony and Junior. With Jackie's death in mid-1999 a succession crisis reached a point where a war within the family appeared imminent. However Tony brought a quick end to the conflict by making Junior the official boss of the family. Junior would unknowingly act as the lightning rod for the Feds while Tony would run the family from behind the scenes as a ''de facto'' boss starting in 2000.

=== Narrated killings committed by Tony Soprano ===

Tony has personally committed eight murders in the show.  Furthermore as a Boss he is responsible for the deaths of others killed on his orders. The eight known murders all explicitly presented onscreen were:

* Willie Overall shot and killed by Tony to  ""make his bones"" (become a made man) (1982 in ""Remember When"").
* Fabian ""Febby"" Petrulio strangled by Tony for ratting out members of Paulie and Pussy's crew and joining the witness protection program (1999 in ""College"").
* Chucky Signore shot and killed by Tony for conspiring to kill him with Junior (1999 in ""I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano"").
* Matthew Bevilaqua killed by Tony and Big Pussy for attempting to kill Christopher Moltisanti (Tony's protégé and cousin in-law) (2000 in ""From Where to Eternity"").
* Salvatore ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero executed by Tony Silvio and Paulie on a yacht after they discovered that he was an FBI informant (2000 in ""Funhouse"").
* Ralph Cifaretto choked/bludgeoned to death in a fight over Ralph's supposedly killing their prize-winning race horse ""Pie-O-My"" for insurance money. (2002 in ""Whoever Did This"").
* Tony Blundetto shot and killed by Tony with a shotgun for the unauthorized killings of Joe Peeps and Billy Leotardo in order to spare him from being the subject of torture from Phil Leotardo in revenge for his brother's death as well as spare his own crew from the threat of retaliation (2004 in ""All Due Respect"").
* Christopher Moltisanti suffocated by Tony following a major car accident with Christopher as the driver and Tony as the passenger Christopher revealed that he was still using drugs and was worried about going to hospital (2007 in ""Kennedy and Heidi"").

It is made clear that some of these murders leave Tony perplexed as to how to cope with the situation; most notably after murdering Christopher Moltisanti he feels a rush of relief for finally being rid of an associate whom he feels he can no longer trust. He has to ""show the sad face"" while the rest of the family grieves but Tony reassures himself that Moltisanti's murder was necessary despite the hurt caused to the family.

The murder of Fabian ""Febby"" Petrulio in ""College"" is out of retaliation for Febby getting members of Tony's crew killed in prison when he rats them out to get immunity. Tony does this out of justice as he has contempt for Febby getting away with it initially.

The murder of ""Big Pussy"" in ""Funhouse"" weighs heavily on Tony. He is at first tempted to spare his old friend and even seems to be in denial for quite a long time but in the end knows his priorities. In the years to follow Tony—along with Silvio and Paulie—have haunting dreams of the murder of their friend.

Tony kills Ralph Cifaretto after their horse Pie-O-My dies amid suspicious circumstances in ""Whoever Did This"". Tony tries to confront Ralph about the situation but after some heated words Tony loses control and murders Ralph following a violent fight. Though no solid proof was found that the fire killing Pie-O-My was arson Tony is convinced Ralph did it. It is also implied that this burst of rage could have been fueled by delayed revenge for Ralph's brutal murder of stripper Tracee considering Tony uttered ""She was a beautiful innocent creature. What'd she ever do to you? You fucking killed her!"" which could apply to both the female horse and the young woman.

The murder of Matthew Bevilaqua was vengeance an act that had to be carried out since the fact that Christopher was shot was a direct affront to him as Boss. Tony takes satisfaction in it as it is revenge for an attempt on the life of one of his relatives. He is however still at unease with the murder due to Bevilaqua's young age.

The murder of his cousin Tony Blundetto (in ""All Due Respect"") is solely to save him from a far worse death if he were to fall into Phil's hands and so that Tony does not lose his reputation as a Boss (as well as sparing the other members of his own crew from Phil's threats of retaliation thus preserving their loyalty).

The murder of his nephew Christopher Moltisanti (in ""Kennedy and Heidi"") was not done out of mob-related necessity. Christopher had been addicted to heroin cocaine and alcohol for many years and had not conquered his addiction in rehab. While Moltisanti presented a threat to Tony's life and the New Jersey Mob it was ultimately an emotional reaction. Tony was about to call 911 following a motor vehicle accident. Christopher who obviously needed urgent medical attention told him that he would ""never pass the drug test"" and would therefore lose his driver's license. He asked Tony to call for a taxi. Tony looked at the baby seat on the backseat of the SUV which had been destroyed by a tree branch closed his phone and suffocated Christopher by holding his nose shut so that he choked to death on his own blood. Tony did not plan to murder Christopher but saw the opportunity after the car accident. Tony was never suspected of this murder.

=== As a father ===
Tony has two children: Meadow Soprano and Anthony (A.J.) Soprano. He also treats Christopher Moltisanti his wife's first cousin once removed as a son in many ways.

Tony was often portrayed as a loving father—he attends his children's sporting events on a regular basis and does all he can to ensure they have luxuries and opportunities. He hopes that both his children will escape the life of crime he has led. Tony takes great pride in Meadow's achievements. In Season 1 he is moved to tears by her performance at a choir recital. He often tells people about her aspiration to become a pediatrician.

He also sometimes alienates his children with his behavior. He has always tried to conceal his criminal life from them—something that Meadow saw through early on and A.J. also realized with guidance from his sister.

Tony's over-protectiveness of Meadow led to feuds between them on several occasions. For example her first boyfriend at college was of black and Jewish ancestry and Tony's racism led him to try to drive him away. Meadow learned of her father's actions and did not speak to him for several months eventually reconciling at Christmas in 2001.

Meadow's next boyfriend was Jackie Aprile Jr. the son of Tony's old friend the late Jackie Aprile Sr. Tony had promised Jackie Jr.'s father that he would keep his son out of the Mafia life. Tony was initially pleased with the relationship believing Jackie to be a hard-working pre-med student from a good family. However since Jackie's uncle Richie Aprile's release from prison and subsequent death Tony realized that Jackie had become more involved in the Mafia when he saw him at strip clubs and a casino. He eventually beat Jackie up to warn him about abusing his daughter's feelings and confiscated his gun. Tony began seeing much of himself and his treatment of Carmela in Jackie's relationship with Meadow.  Jackie was killed by Vito for his involvement in a robbery at Christopher's and Furio's executive card game and for shooting a made man Furio. This drove Meadow to drinking and depression although they'd broken up shortly before his death.

After Jackie's death Tony accepts Meadow's college friends and gets along well with her fiancé Finn before the two separated under unrevealed circumstances.

When Meadow is out for dinner with her ""mystery"" boyfriend Patrick Parisi New York mob member Coco walks up to the table and makes drunk remarks about her looks and how ""Tony must love tucking you in at night"". After taking advice from her mother Meadow tells Tony who hides his rage and says Coco is ""harmless"" and ""an idiot"". Tony then tracks down Coco and Butch DeConcini at John's Restaurant on East 12th Street in Manhattan. Tony viciously pistol-whips Coco several times with a snubnose revolver and warns Butch at gunpoint to shut up and remain seated at his table. After breaking off some of Coco's teeth with a curb stomp Tony leaves the restaurant.

Tony's feelings toward his son are mixed; he worries about his future. From the beginning Tony had doubts that his son could succeed in the Mafia telling Dr. Melfi ""he'd never make it"". His fears are confirmed as A.J. consistently demonstrates throughout the series that he lacks his father's cunning and dominating persona. Tony tells A.J. numerous times that he is proud that his son is gentle and kind. Tony was especially proud of A.J.'s prowess on the football field even amid his failing grades in high school but is frustrated with A.J.'s lack of focus after graduation.

After flunking out of Ramapo State A.J. loafs around the house parties and for a time holds a job at Blockbuster until his father gets him a job working construction. There A.J. meets Blanca and in Tony's opinion A.J. was doing well until he and Blanca broke up. Tony worries about A.J.'s depression the 'rotten putrid Soprano gene' that Tony believes he passed down to his son.

Hoping to get A.J. back on track Tony rekindles A.J.'s friendship with ""the Jasons"" sons of two of his associates and A.J. seems to be doing better. With the help of a therapist and medication A.J. is finally getting back to college this time at Rutgers University to take classes and party with girls as Tony believes every college kid should. This later turns sour after A.J. sees his new friends attack a Somalian student on a bike and he regresses into depression. A.J. tries to drown himself in a swimming pool but decides he wants to live; he is unable to escape the pool however. Tony hears his cries for help and rescues him. After A.J. is released from a mental health ward Tony and Carmela dissuade him from joining the Army and convince him instead to become involved in a film bankrolled by Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. with the possibility of opening his own club.

=== Interests and hobbies ===
Tony is an avid animal lover and enjoys feeding the ducks which visit his pool. He has a sentimental attachment towards animals as he had been traumatized by the loss of his childhood dog (as revealed in the episode ""In Camelot"") whose name was ""Tippy"". When he goes to confront Angie Bonpensiero as she's walking her poodle the dog greets Tony in a friendly manner to which Tony reciprocates. In Christopher Moltisanti's intervention when Tony hears Christopher accidentally suffocated Adrianna's dog he was furious saying ""I oughta suffocate you you little prick!"" He becomes involved in horse racing through his friend Hesh Rabkin who owns a stable and invests in a racehorse named Pie-O-My. When his horse is killed in a fire – possibly set by Ralph Cifaretto – Tony is deeply upset and saddened and kills Cifaretto yelling: ""She was a beautiful innocent creature. What did she ever do to you?"" He repeats ""You fucking killed her!"" while banging Cifaretto's head against the floor. When informed by Carmela that a black bear has been foraging in his home's backyard while they were separated during Season 5 he reacts with interest rather than fear. During his stay in the hospital after his shooting he can be seen reading a book about dinosaurs given by Carmela. In the series finale Tony finds a stray cat at his safehouse during the war with New York and takes a liking to it. He brings it back to Satriale's where it stares at the deceased Chris Moltisanti's photo (much to Paulie's dismay).

Tony is seen many times over the course of the show engaging in both freshwater and saltwater angling. His son Anthony Jr. sometimes accompanies him on fishing outings. During the second season he presents his son with a Fenwick rod and a Penn International reel both extremely high quality products. In the sixth season while in Florida with Paulie he rents a sport fishing boat. He is sometimes haunted by visions of Pussy Bonpensiero incarnated in the form of a fish – presumably a reference to the disposal of his body in the ocean. A Big Mouth Billy Bass novelty singing fish brought into the Bada Bing by Georgie and another later presented to him as a Christmas present by his daughter Meadow recalled his nightmare and disturbed him greatly.

Tony enjoys fresh air by himself gazing over water and having a cigar at the same time which is seen throughout the series.

He is also a gun enthusiast and is shown to have an arsenal in his home. He gives guns as birthday gifts to his father-in-law Hugh DeAngelis (in ""Marco Polo"") and received one from Bobby Baccialieri on his own birthday (in ""Soprano Home Movies"").

Tony enjoys sports particularly baseball football basketball golf and horse racing. He played baseball and football at West Essex High School and is a fan of the New York Yankees and New York Jets. He has taken A.J. to New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils games occasionally throughout the series. Some objects and posters in A.J.'s room confirm this. He plays golf with John Sacrimoni at Upper Montclair Country Club. A large portion of his income is derived from illegal sports betting.

Tony is an amateur yachtsman and has owned two motor yachts over the course of the show: ''Stugots'' and ''Stugots II''. The name comes from the Southern Italian phrase ''stu cazz'' meaning ""This dick"" or in paraphrase ""Fuck it"".

Tony maintains an avid interest in history particularly World War II. Throughout seasons 4 and 5 Tony is seen watching Vietnam War documentaries. He is a big fan of President John F. Kennedy and owns one of his captain sailor hats which he won at an auction. He is often shown watching programs on the History Channel about great leaders such as George S. Patton Erwin Rommel and Winston Churchill. He reads ''The Art of War'' by Sun Tzu which is quoted by several other characters on the show particularly Paulie Gualtieri.

Tony is often seen watching classic mob films. For example he is shown watching ''The Public Enemy'' (1931) throughout the episode ""Proshai Livushka"" which addresses his mother's death. He also shares a love for ''The Godfather'' series (wondering what went wrong in the third installment).

Tony listens to classic rock and pop music particularly of the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the show he is seen to enjoy AC/DC Deep Purple Eagles Eric Clapton Jefferson Airplane Jethro Tull Journey Lynyrd Skynyrd Pink Floyd Rush Steely Dan The Clash The Chi-Lites The Lost Boys Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers and Van Morrison.

===Vehicles===
Like most of the mobsters in the series Tony is shown to be partial to Cadillac and Lincoln vehicles. When discussing with Dr. Melfi a bizarre dream in which his penis fell off he mentions that he went to the guy who used to ""work on my Lincoln when I drove Lincolns"". For the first four seasons Tony drives a burgundy 1999 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4x4 but in season 5 this has been replaced with a black Cadillac Escalade ESV. This black Escalade is totaled in an accident and quickly replaced with a white Escalade ESV. Tony has this Escalade until the end of the series.

=== Extramarital affairs ===
Throughout the series Tony is shown to be a serial adulterer. He typically has mistresses whom he consistently sees for long periods of time though he also has a number of brief one-night stands with strippers from the Bada Bing.

His wife Carmela is tacitly aware of his infidelity and usually views it as a form of masturbation though sometimes the bottled-up tensions explode in domestic arguments. At the end of Season 4 Irina telephones Carmela in a jealous rage at Tony's cheating on her with her cousin Svetlana which causes Carmela to finally snap. Carmela throws Tony out of the house and begins divorce proceedings.

Tony has a strong preference for women of European particularly Italian descent with dark hair and eyes and exotic features. His mistresses have been in chronological order of Russian (Irina and later Svetlana) Italian (Gloria Trillo) Italian/Cuban (Valentina La Paz) and Jewish descent (Julianna Skiff). He favors dark features but also has a few brief flings with blonde American European women including a stewardess from Icelandic Airways and a medical assistant. He had one very short encounter with an Asian-American escort during ''The Test Dream''.

Mistresses:

* Irina Peltsin – a young Russian woman whom he sees consistently throughout the first two seasons. She is a severe alcoholic and frequently calls Tony's house when drunk and when Carmela hints that she knows that he is seeing her he breaks off the relationship. After her failed suicide attempt Tony sends Silvio to give her a money compensation of $75000 and try to reason her into moving on with her life.
* Gloria Trillo – an Italian-American Mercedes-Benz saleswoman with stylish tastes. Tony dates her throughout Season 3 after meeting her at Dr. Melfi's office (Dr. Melfi repeatedly expresses her disapproval of their relationship knowing it will likely turn out a disaster). He eventually stops seeing her when she begins stalking him and calling his house while exhibiting manipulative behaviours reminding him of his own mother (which was foreshadowed very early on when she teased him by saying ""poor you"" jokingly at first). He also understands through Dr. Melfi's hints that Gloria is trying to use him as a means to commit suicide (akin to the suicide by cop phenomenon). Tony asks Patsy Parisi to threaten her (he tells her that if she tries again to harass Tony the last face she'll see will be his not Tony's and that ""it won't be cinematic""). It turns out that it throws her over the edge as she commits suicide soon afterwards hanging herself. This greatly upsets Tony who blames it on himself as well as Dr. Melfi.
* Valentina La Paz – a beautiful art dealer of Italian and Cuban descent initially the mistress of Ralph Cifaretto. Tony dates her throughout Season 4. They share a love of horses and she visits Pie-O-My at the stable with Tony. She accidentally sets her robe on fire in Season 5 while cooking eggs for Tony. Shortly thereafter he decides to get back together with Carmela and he breaks up with Valentina while she is in the hospital recovering from second degree burns to her head face and arm. Tony offers to take care of any cost related to her treatment but their relationship ends on bad terms.
* Svetlana Kirilenko – the maternal cousin of Tony's ex-comàre Irina and the manager of a home care nursing business. During her childhood Svetlana developed an osteosarcoma in her leg which was amputated soon afterwards. Tony comments that she looks like the actress Greta Garbo. She was first hired as Livia Soprano's nurse since Janice had left town. Svetlana resurfaces as Uncle Junior's nurse after he suffers a fall at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior's sofa but they are caught by Junior's nurse Branca. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair prompting Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. Svetlana later tells Tony that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck. Tony admires Svetlana for her toughness of spirit and her refusal to allow her disability and misfortune to get in the way of her ambitions. Arguably Svetlana is the most psychologically balanced of all Tony's extramarital affairs.
* Julianna Skiff – a real estate developer of Jewish descent. She meets Tony in Season 6 when offering to buy a building that he owns to be converted into a Jamba Juice. They later begin an affair along with a business relationship but never consummate their relationship sexually; Tony backs off and decides to be faithful to Carmela who stuck with him after the shooting and seemed re-devoted to him. Julianna eventually dates Christopher Moltisanti and the two begin a very destructive co-dependent drug habit; she is last seen attending Christopher's funeral service where she mentions that they had split up.

=== Therapy ===
Tony has suffered from panic attacks that sometimes cause him to lose consciousness since his childhood. He has his first on-screen panic attack while cooking sausages at his son's birthday party—this occurs in a flashback in the pilot episode. Tony loses consciousness and causes a small explosion when he drops a bottle of lighter fluid onto the coals. Tony describes the experience of the panic attack as feeling like he had ""ginger ale in his skull"". This prompts him to seek help for the attacks. After extensive testing that includes an MRI scan and blood work no physical cause can be found so Dr. Cusamano referred Tony to psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi.

Tony's therapy allows a discussion of his thoughts and feelings away from both aspects of his life—this forum for reaching into the character's thoughts has been described as a Greek chorus and as a key for viewers to understand the character.

Tony was initially very resistant to the idea that there was a psychiatric cause for his symptoms. He resented being in therapy and refused to accept the diagnosis of panic attacks given him by the neurologists who had investigated his illness. Tony begins to open up once Dr. Melfi explains the doctor-patient confidentiality rules. He tells her about the stress of his business life—he has a feeling that he has come in at the end of something and describes a reverence for the glorified ""old days"" of the Mafia. Tony leaves out the violence associated with his criminal career. Tony tells Dr. Melfi a story about ducks landing in his pool. He describes his mother Livia a cold mean-spirited woman with whom he has an openly hostile relationship. By the end of the first session Tony has admitted that he feels depressed but storms out when Dr. Melfi presses him further about the relationship between his symptoms and the ducks.

When the family visits Green Grove a retirement community where Tony is trying to place his mother Livia's derisive outburst prompts a second panic attack. Melfi prescribes Prozac as an anti-depressant telling him that no one needs to suffer from depression with the wonders of modern pharmacology. Tony fails to attend their next scheduled session.

At their next session Tony is still reluctant to face his own psychological weaknesses. Tony is quick to credit the medication for his improved mood but Dr. Melfi tells him it cannot be that as it takes six weeks to work—she credits their therapy sessions. Tony describes a dream where a bird steals his penis. Melfi extrapolates that Tony has projected his love for his family onto the family of ducks living in his pool. This brings him to tears to his consternation. She tells him that their flight from the pool sparked his panic attack through the overwhelming fear of somehow losing his own family.

In the episode ""46 Long"" they continue discussing Tony's mother and her difficulties living alone. Tony admits that he feels guilty because his mother could not be allowed to live with his family. We learn that he has been left to care for his mother alone by his sisters. When Dr. Melfi asks him to remember good experiences from his childhood he has difficulty. He blames Carmela for preventing his mother from living with them. Later they discuss Livia's car accident and Melfi suggests depression may have contributed to the accident – Tony misunderstands her and becomes angry. Tony has a panic attack while visiting his mother's home after she moves to Green Grove. In a later session Dr. Melfi pushes Tony to admit he has feelings of anger towards his mother and he again storms out. During this episode Tony introduces the concept of him acting like the sad clown – happy on the outside but sad on the inside.

In ""Denial Anger Acceptance"" Tony discusses Jackie's cancer with Dr. Melfi. She tries to use it as an example of Tony's negative thinking contributing to his depression. Tony becomes angry and storms out. He feels she is trying to trick him and manipulate his thoughts using the pictures that decorate her office. After Jackie worsens and Tony is called a Frankenstein by a business associate he returns to therapy to discuss these things with Dr. Melfi. She asks him if he feels like a monster.

In ""Fortunate Son"" Tony discusses a childhood memory of an early panic attack. He saw his father and uncle mutilate Mr. Satriale the local butcher and later fainted at a family dinner made with free meat from Satriale's shop. Dr. Melfi makes a connection between meat and Tony's panic attacks. She explores his mother's attitude to the fruits of his father's labor.

Later Dr. Melfi tries prescribing Lithium as a mood stabilizer. In the episode ""Isabella"" Tony sinks into a severe depressive episode and experiences hallucinations—he sees a beautiful Italian woman named Isabella in his neighbor's garden. Tony sees Isabella several times during the episode and later learns that she never existed. Melfi theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure that Tony's subconscious produced because he was deeply upset about his own mother's actions at the time.

In ""I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano"" Tony abruptly ends his therapy and persuades Dr. Melfi to go into hiding when he discovers that Uncle Junior has found out about their sessions.

The relationship between Tony and Dr. Melfi is up-and-down with Tony reaching a level of comfort with Dr. Melfi that he has never experienced with anyone else before not even his wife. This closeness leads Tony to have something of a ""crush"" on Dr. Melfi something that is unattainable. However the ""prying"" from Dr. Melfi is uncomfortable for Tony and he often turns sarcastic and antagonistic towards her leading to an ongoing strain in their relationship. In the episode when Tony's sister Janice goes back to Seattle it is revealed during a rushed conversation between Janice and Tony that their mother suffers from narcissistic personality disorder.

During the episode ""The Second Coming"" aired in part II of season six Melfi's own therapist suggests to her that her work with Tony could be considered enabling toward Tony's sociopathic tendencies. Finally in the penultimate episode of the series ""The Blue Comet"" Melfi severs her relationship with Tony after reading research recommended by her own therapist that indicates sociopaths can use talk therapy to improve their skills in manipulating others and use what is learned in therapy to become more capable criminals.

=== Shootings ===
In the first season Tony is attacked by William Johnson ""Petite"" Clayborn and Rasheen Ray two thugs sent by Donnie Paduana to execute Tony. Tony sustains an injury to his ear which is partially shot off and minor bruises and cuts from crashing his vehicle. One of the two assailants Clayborn is shot dead by Ray in an attempt to kill Tony and Ray is left bruised but runs off.

In the premiere of the sixth season ""Members Only"" Junior Soprano suffering from dementia believes Tony to be ""Little Pussy"" Malanga and shoots him in the abdomen. Tony dials 911 but loses consciousness before being able to tell the operator what happened.

The second episode of the sixth season ""Join the Club"" Tony is in a medically induced coma in the hospital. In the second and third episode the viewer sees Tony in a dream-like state eventually arriving at what could be purgatory where he is greeted by a man who takes the physical form of his late cousin Tony Blundetto. The shadowy figure in the doorway of the house has the profile of his mother who is dead. The voice of a younger version of his daughter calls him back. At the end of the third episode he awakes from his coma in a confused but stable state.

By the fourth episode Tony is mobile and fully aware and has regained his voice. Tony's attitude to life has changed by his near death experience. He has yet to discuss his experiences while unconscious with anyone close to him. However in the Season 6 episode ""Kaisha"" he admits to Phil Leotardo (who had just suffered a heart attack) that while he was in a coma he went to a place where he never wants to go again. While talking philosophy with John Schwinn another patient at the hospital he mentions that while in the coma he had the experience of being drawn towards somewhere he did not want to go and narrowly avoided it.

In the sixth episode of season 6 part 2 ""Kennedy and Heidi"" Tony sustains minor injuries in a car accident that seriously injures his nephew Christopher Moltisanti. Tony suffocates Christopher after this accident. Tony was on bed rest for a few days and quickly recovered. Nonetheless this gave his family quite a scare and a painful memory of his nearly fatal shooting the previous year.

===Dreams===
Tony sometimes has vivid dreams that are shown to the viewer. Episodes with dream sequences include ""Pax Soprana"" ""Isabella"" ""Funhouse"" ""Everybody Hurts"" ""Calling All Cars"" and ""The Test Dream"".

In the pilot Tony tells Dr. Melfi about a dream he had wherein a screw in his belly button when removed causes his penis to fall off. He tries to find a car mechanic (who had worked on his Lincoln when Tony drove Lincolns) to put it back on but a duck swoops down and snatches it from his hand.

In ""Meadowlands"" Tony has a dream that several people in his life are present in Dr. Melfi's office: Herman ""Hesh"" Rabkin scrolling by the window A.J. behind the door Silvio Dante having sex with a woman in the waiting room and Paulie Walnuts and Big Pussy reading Chinese newspapers. This causes him to worry that people will find out he is seeing a psychiatrist. The dream ends with Tony confronting Melfi seeing Jackie Aprile Sr. in his death bed smoking a cigarette asking Tony ""You smell that? That's rain."" and only to find out that Melfi is his mother Livia.

In ""Pax Soprana"" Tony has several dreams and fantasies about Dr. Melfi. He becomes convinced that he is in love with her but she turns him down when he makes advances towards her.

In ""Isabella"" Tony suffering from depression after Big Pussy disappears acquaints himself with a dental student named Isabella who is staying in the Cusamano home while they are on vacation. He later discovers that he'd hallucinated Isabella due to taking too much lithium and that Isabella represented the mother he never had.

In ""Funhouse"" an extended dream sequence exposes many of Tony's subconscious thoughts and feelings through symbolic and sometimes bizarre events: he attempts suicide to preempt a doctor's diagnosis of early death by dousing himself in gasoline and lighting himself on fire; he witnesses himself shooting Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gaultieri to death during a card game; he has an innuendo-laden conversation with his therapist Dr. Melfi while sporting a prominent erection; and a fish that speaks with the voice of Sal ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero confirms his suspicions that the longtime friend and soldier is a federal informant.

In ""Everybody Hurts"" Tony dreams of his ex-comaré Gloria Trillo shortly after learning of her suicide by hanging. He visits her apartment and finds her in a black dress with a black scarf around her neck. She is cooking dinner and when she goes over to the oven the scarf drapes across Tony. Plaster falls down in front of Tony and when he looks up he sees that the chandelier is almost pulled out of the ceiling. Gloria is suddenly back at the table and offers Tony a choice between seeing what she has under her dress or under her scarf. As she begins to peel away the scarf Tony wakes up and makes his way to the bathroom for some medication.

In ""Calling All Cars"" Tony has two dreams featuring Ralph Cifaretto. In the first he is being driven by Carmela in the back of his father's old car while Ralph sits in the passenger seat. There is a caterpillar crawling on the back of Ralph's head. Tony's fellow passenger in the back seat changes—Gloria Trillo and Svetlana Kirilenko are both seen. The caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Dr. Melfi later tells him that the dream signifies a change for Ralphie (recently killed by Tony) and Carmela being in control which Tony doesn't like.

In the second dream Tony follows Ralph to an old house which Ralph enters. Tony is dressed in trousers suspenders and an undershirt. He knocks on the door and a female figure descends slowly in shadow; the door creaks ominously. Tony says he is there for the stonemason job but does not speak English well (Tony's grandfather was an immigrant stonemason). Just as Tony is about to enter the house he wakes up.

In ""The Test Dream"" Tony comes to terms with having to kill his cousin Tony Blundetto. The episode reflects on his inner demons and fears including his children's future his relationship with his wife his infidelities deceased acquaintances—including some who have died by his hand or by his orders—his fate and his relationship with his father. He is again shown in his father's old car accompanied by a range of past associates.

In ""Join the Club"" a comatose Tony finds himself in an alternate universe where he is a law-abiding salesman on a business trip.  Among other differences his accent has changed and his hotel's bartender condescends him (in sharp contrast to the bartender at The Bing who is a recurring punching bag for Tony).  Tony has mistakenly taken another man's briefcase – Kevin Finnerty's – along with all of his identification and work.  The episode follows his attempts to discern his identity recover his briefcase and get back to his family.

In ""Kennedy and Heidi"" a stressed Tony Soprano has a dream following the death of Christopher Moltisanti. In this dream he tells his therapist that Christopher was a burden and that he is relieved that he was dead. After that he also tells her that he murdered Big Pussy and his cousin Tony Blundetto. Following the dream he acts differently to his friends and family trying to see if they also feel relieved now that Christopher is dead.

810426,Schneider ES-65,Design and development,"The Edmund Schneider company was originally based in Grunau Silesia but reformed after World War II in Adelaide Australia producing the successful Schneider ES-60 from 1960 until 1970. Anticipating an Australian market for an ES-60-based side by side two-seater Harry Schneider began design and construction of the '''ES-64''' a marriage of ES-60 wings with a new glass reinforced plastic (GRP) fuselage.  Australian gliding clubs showed little interest and the project proceeded slowly. In the early 1980s Schneider revived it with a simplified version the ES-65 ''Platypus''.

The ''Platypus'' has the extended plywood skinned ES-60 wing built around a single spar. The leading edge is unswept but the straight trailing edges have forward sweep that increases on the outer aileron-carrying panels.  There are airbrakes mounted just aft of the spar on the inner panels. These wings were mid-mounted onto a new GRP fuselage.  This has a maximum width of 1.20 m (3 ft 11 in) to accommodate the side by side seating but narrowed in pod and boom style particularly in plan behind the wings. The cockpit has a two-piece fixed screen extending almost to the nose and is accessed via a rear hinged bulged canopy.  The pod includes a fixed faired centre-line two wheel undercarriage with a brake-equipped mainwheel under the wings and a smaller nosewheel.

The tail is also mostly GRP though the elevator uses carbon fibre for lightness. These surfaces are straight-edged and tapering the fin is tall with a rudder that extends to the bottom of the fuselage.  The high aspect ratio horizontal tail surface is mounted midway up the fin.

The ''Platypus'' made its first flight in August 1984 and its handling and performance were generally judged to be good.  There were plans to produce an all-GRP version but the funding required was not available and no more ES-65s were built.

411087,Fobos-Grunt,Mission plan,"
===Journey===
The spacecraft's journey to Mars would take about ten months. After arriving in Mars orbit the main propulsion unit and the transfer truss would separate and the Chinese Mars orbiter would be released. Fobos-Grunt would then spend several months studying the planet and its moons from orbit before landing on Phobos. It was imperative to prevent the introduction to Mars of contaminants from Earth; according to Fobos-Grunt Chief Designer Maksim Martynov the probability of the probe accidentally reaching the surface of Mars was much lower than the maximum specified for Category III missions the type assigned to Fobos-Grunt and defined in COSPAR's planetary protection policy (in accordance with Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty).

===On Phobos===
Phobos
The planned landing site at Phobos was a region from 5°S to 5°N 230° to 235°E. Soil sample collection would begin immediately after the lander touched down on Phobos with collection lasting 2–7 days. An emergency mode existed for the case of communications breakdown which enabled the lander to automatically launch the return rocket to deliver the samples to Earth.

A robotic arm would have collected samples up to  in diameter. At the end of the arm was a pipe-shaped tool which split to form a claw. The tool contained a piston which would have pushed the sample into a cylindrical container. A light-sensitive photo-diode would have confirmed whether material collection was successful and also allowed visual inspection of the digging area. The sample extraction device would have performed 15 to 20 scoops yielding a total of  of soil. The samples would be loaded into a capsule which would then be moved inside a special pipeline into the descent module by inflating an elastic bag within the pipe with gas. Because the characteristics of Phobos soil are uncertain the lander included another soil-extraction device a Polish-built drill which would have been used in case the soil turned out to be too rocky for the main scooping device.

After the departure of the return stage the lander's experiments would have continued ''in situ'' on Phobos' surface for a year. To conserve power mission control would have turned these on and off in a precise sequence. The robotic arm would have placed more samples in a chamber that would heat it and analyze its emission spectra. This analysis might have been able to determine the presence of volatile compounds such as water.

===Sample return to Earth===
The return stage was mounted on top of the lander. It would have needed to accelerate to  to escape Phobos' gravity. In order to avoid harming the experiments remaining at the lander the return stage would have ignited its engine once the vehicle had been vaulted to a safe height by springs. It would then have begun maneuvers for the eventual trip to Earth where it would have arrived in August 2014. An 11-kg descent vehicle containing the capsule with soil samples (up to ) would have been released on direct approach to Earth at . Following the aerodynamic braking to  the conical-shaped descent vehicle would perform a hard landing without a parachute within the Sary Shagan test range in Kazakhstan. The vehicle did not have any radio equipment. Ground-based radar and optical observations would have been used to track the vehicle's return.

326910,CYP2D6,Ethnic factors in variability,"
Race is a factor in the occurrence of CYP2D6 variability. The prevalence of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is approximately 6–10% in white populations but is lower in most other ethnic groups such as Asians (2%). In African-Americans the frequency of poor metabolizers is greater than for whites. The occurrence of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers appears to be greater among Middle Eastern and North African populations.

Caucasians with European descent predominantly (around 71%) have the functional group of CYP2D6 alleles while functional alleles represent only around 50% of the allele frequency in populations of Asian descent.

This variability is accounted for by the differences in the prevalence of various ''CYP2D6'' alleles among the populations–approximately 10% of whites are intermediate metabolizers due to decreased CYP2D6 function because they appear to have the non-functional ''CYP2D6*4'' allele while approximately 50% of Asians possess the decreased functioning ''CYP2D6*10'' allele.

100966,Cod Wars,Results,"Iceland achieved its overall aims. As a result the already declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from their prime fishing grounds and the economies of the large northern fishing ports in the United Kingdom such as Grimsby Hull and Fleetwood were severely affected with thousands of skilled fishermen and people in related trades being put out of work. The cost for repairing the damaged Royal Navy frigates was probably over £1 million.

In 2012 the British government offered a multimillion-pound compensation deal and apology to fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the 1970s. More than 35 years after the workers lost their jobs the £1000 compensation offered to 2500 fisherman was criticised for being insufficient and excessively delayed.

230422,Arthur Tansley,Major contributions,"Tansley's early publications focused on palaeobotany especially fern evolution. Tansley founded the botany journal ''New Phytologist'' in 1902 to serve as ""a medium of easy communication and discussion between British botanists on all matters . . . including methods of teaching and research"". It was named after ''The Phytologist'' a botanical magazine published between 1842 and 1863. In establishing this journal Tansley's aim was to provide a venue for the publication of ""notes and suggestions""; existing botanical journals only published records of completed research. He remained editor of the journal until 1931.

Tansley's introduction to ecology came in 1898 when he read Warming's ''Plantesamfund'' (in its German translation ''Lehrbuch der ökologischen Pflanzengeographie''). Reading the book provoked him to ""go out into the field to see how far one could match the plant communities Warming had described for Denmark in the English countryside"". In 1903 he learned of the work done by the Smith brothers in mapping the vegetation of Scotland and Yorkshire. The work was initiated by Robert Smith and continued by his brother William Gardner Smith (in conjunction with Charles Edward Moss) after Robert's death. In 1904 Tansley suggested the formation of a central body for the systematic survey and mapping of the British Isles. This led to the establishment of the ""Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation"" by Tansley Moss William Smith and T. W. Woodhead with the support of Marcel Hardy F. J. Lewis Lloyd Praeger and W. M. Rankin. These eight formed the original committee with Tansley as its leader. F. W. Oliver later joined the group as its ninth member. The name of the group was later shortened to ""The British Vegetation Committee"". The aim of the group was to coordinate ongoing studies and standardise the methodology being used. The committee met twice more in 1905 and produced a six-page pamphlet ''Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation''.

In 1911 Tansley in conjunction with the British Vegetation Committee organised the first International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE). He was inspired by a plant geography tour of Switzerland organised by Swiss botanist Carl Schröter in 1908 which introduced him not only to vegetation types but also to botanists from other countries. The connections made between Tansley and American ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements helped build a philosophical and methodological link between British and American plant ecology. Other attendees included Schröter Swedish botanist Carl Lindman and German botanists Oscar Drude and Paul Graebner. Tansley's book ''Types of British Vegetation'' was prepared with an eye to serving as a guide to the vegetation for the attendees of the first IPE. The second IPE in 1913 was hosted by Cowles. This brought Tansley to America.

In 1913 the British Vegetation Committee organised the British Ecological Society (BES) the first-ever professional society of ecologists. Tansley served as its first president and was first editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' a position he held for 21 years. In 1915 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1923 he was elected president of the Botanical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. At the Imperial Botanical Congress in 1924 he was appointed chairman of the British Empire Vegetation Committee. He served as president of the BES a second time in 1938.

William S. Cooper considered Tansley's most influential publications synthesised individual studies into a whole. In 1935 Tansley published ""The use and abuse of vegetational terms and concepts"" in which he introduced the ecosystem concept. In the 1930s ecological thinking was dominated by the work of Clements who thought of ecological communities as organisms and associations as superorganisms. Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment regarding ecosystems as the basic units of nature.
Tansley's interest in teaching led to the production of the ''Elements of Plant Ecology'' in 1922 which was followed by ''Practical Plant Ecology'' in 1923 and ''Aims and methods in the study of vegetation'' in 1926 coauthored with Thomas Ford Chipp. The last book edited for the British Empire vegetation committee was extremely influential not just in defining ecological methods but in highlighting the need for a complete inventory of the empire's ""vegetational assets"". With this information it would be possible to efficiently manage the vast natural resources of the empire. Tansley's most comprehensive work ''The British Islands and Their Vegetation'' was published in 1939. In recognition of this achievement he was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1941.

During the Second World War Tansley became committed to conservation and this continued through post-war reconstruction. He chaired a committee of the BES that formulated a policy on nature reserves and led to the formation of the Nature Conservancy which he also chaired. Tansley's conservation work was the basis cited for his knighthood in 1950.

Tansley was introduced to psychology by a former student Bernard Hart who worked as a doctor in mental hospitals near London.  While working for the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War he had a dream which was described as ""one of the major turning points in his life"" – from this dream came Tansley's interest in Freud and psychoanalysis. In 1920 he published ''The New Psychology and its Relation to Life'' one of the first books that attempted to introduce the ideas of Freud and Carl Jung to a general audience. The book was a bestseller selling 10000 copies in the United Kingdom and 4000 in the United States. In 1922 Tansley spent three months with Freud and the following year he moved his family to Vienna for a year. Although he later returned to botanical pursuits Tansley remained in contact with Freud and wrote his obituary. Recent research by Peder Anker has suggested a close theoretical relationship between Tansley's ecology and his psychology.

365471,Yamada Arinobu,Introduction,"

 was a retainer of the Shimazu clan during the Edo period.  He served under Shimazu Takahisa and then under Shimazu Yoshihisa.  On 1568 he became a Karō for his services.

He was known as a skilled commander in battle.  On 1578 Ōtomo Yoshishige attacked the Shimazu clan and Arinobu gathered 500 troops to hold ground at Taka Castle. Managing to defend the castle led to a decline in the morale of Otomo's troops. In the Battle of Mimigawa that followed the Shimazu army defeated the Otomo who retreated under heavy losses losing commanders like Kamachi Akimori from which it never recovered.

In 1586 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched the invasion of Kyūshū and Shimazu clan territory Arinobu again gathered a handful of troops to take a defensive stand after the main body of the army led by Shimazu Yoshihisa had lost. Refusing to surrender to Toyotomi's troops Arinobu surrendered only after Yoshihisa ordered him to surrender and offered Toyotomi his son Yamada Arinaga as hostage.

Yamada died in 1609 and it is said that Yoshihisa prayed in front of his coffin thanking him for his long service.

220312,Egan v Canada,Background,"James Egan and John Norris Nesbit the plaintiffs were a gay couple who had been in a conjugal relationship since 1948. Upon reaching age 65 in 1986 Egan became eligible to receive Old Age Security and a guaranteed income supplement from the government under the ''Old Age Security Act''.

The ''Old Age Security Act'' provides that a spouse of the pensioner may receive a spousal allowance should their combined income fall below a certain amount. When Nesbit reached 65 he applied to the Department of National Health and Welfare for a spousal allowance. However he was refused on the basis that spouse defined in section 2 of ''Old Age Security Act'' did not include a member of the same sex.

Joseph J. Arvay Q.C. represented the plaintiffs Egan and Nesbit who delivered a motion for a declaration of unconstitutionality to the Federal Court of Canada (Trial Division). They alleged that the definition of ""spouse"" under the ''Old Age Security Act'' constituted an infringement of their right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law entrenched in section 15 of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' and that such an infringement was discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation. Furthermore they alleged that the section 15 violation could not be saved under Section 1. Nesbit and Egan petitioned the Court to remedy the alleged Charter violation by reading the definition of spouse so as to include same-sex couples.

363985,Jo Whiley,Career,"
===Early career===
In Whiley's final year of her degree still unsure of what she wanted to do a conversation with a lecturer led to a job with BBC Radio Sussex on a show called ''Turn It Up''. It allowed anyone to get on the radio and required Whiley to attend shows and interview the musicians.

After a year Whiley left for City University London for a one-year course on radio journalism. After writing many letters she got a job as a researcher on WPFM a BBC Radio 4 youth culture and music show. When the presenters Terry Christian and Gary Crowley left she took over gaining her first presenting role. She then moved into television firstly at British Satellite Broadcasting where she produced and presented the indie show and then at Channel 4 where she worked as a researcher on ''The Word'' with her friend Zoë Ball. Whiley moved on to BBC Radio 1 from September 1993 until March 2011 during the heyday of Britpop with bands such as Blur and Oasis. She hosted a weekday evening show called ''The Evening Session'' with Steve Lamacq which was oriented towards less-mainstream non-dance music. Whiley presented her own show on Saturday afternoon in late 1995.

From 1995 to 1998 Whiley was a regular guest presenter on Top of the Pops initially co-presenting with fellow DJ Steve Lamacq before flying solo and alternating with Zoë Ball and Jayne Middlemiss. The three women  are referred to by the Top of the Pops website as the '90s girls' as between them they presented nearly every show of 1997. However the only occasion when all three presented together was on Christmas Day 1997. Whiley returned to the show twice between 2005–06 to co-present with lead presenter Fearne Cotton.

In July 2009 Whiley published her autobiography ''My World in Motion'' on CD from Random House Audiobooks.

===''The Jo Whiley Show'' on BBC Radio 1===

From February 1997 Whiley had a weekday lunchtime show called ''The Jo Whiley Show'' and later ''The Lunchtime Social''. This included elements of the evening show such as tour dates and occasional live 'sessions' at Maida Vale Studios while working within the restrictions of Radio 1's daytime schedule. When Simon Mayo left Radio 1 for Radio Five Live in February 2001 Whiley's show was moved to a mid-morning slot.

As of 2005  the BBC paid Whiley a salary of £250000.

In July 2008 ''The Jo Whiley Show'' was fined £75000 for misleading listeners for an incident involving  a member of BBC staff posing as a member of the public taking part in a competition. The BBC claim Whiley herself was unaware of the deception at the time of its broadcast.

In July 2009 it was announced that the Jo Whiley show would end broadcasting  in September as part of a major shake-up of Radio 1's weekday schedule. The shake-up billed as the biggest at Radio 1 for five years would see Greg James move to the afternoon slot (then occupied by Edith Bowman) and Fearne Cotton move to Whiley's slot.

Cotton took over many of Whiley's popular features including the famous Live Lounge segment. Although both Whiley and Bowman moved to weekend slots on Radio 1 the news that the duo would leave their weekday shows led to controversy with BBC bosses facing allegations of being biased against older presenters particularly as the announcement came shortly after the revelation that 30-year-old singer Alesha Dixon would replace the much older Arlene Phillips as a judge on ''Strictly Come Dancing''. Her final weekday programme took place on 18 September 2009.

Following the Jo Whiley Show Whiley went on to present a weekend show on Radio 1 between 1pm and 4pm. As with her weekday show it still featured live performances from visiting artists as well as three new features: Jo's Road Trip and Top of the Shops and SpellStar. Her last show on Radio 1 was on 27 March 2011.

===BBC Radio 2===
Jo Whiley at the Electric Proms in 2010
Since August 2009 Whiley has been an occasional stand in presenter for Claudia Winkleman on Radio 2. She was first heard on the network on Friday 21 August and made subsequent appearances on 2 October 6 November 27 November and 18 December 2009.

In March 2010 it was announced that Whiley and fellow Radio 1 presenter Steve Lamacq would present a one-off Evening Session (the first in 13 years) on Good Friday (2 April) for BBC 6 Music. Presented another Evening Session on 28 January 2011. After being an occasional stand-in presenter on BBC Radio 2 Whiley began presenting ''In Concert'' on Thursday evenings in April 2010.

On 1 February 2011 it was announced that Whiley would be leaving BBC Radio 1 after 17 years to move to Radio 2 where she would present an evening show from Mondays to Thursdays starting on 4 April 2011 replacing ''The Radcliffe and Maconie Show''. Radcliffe and Maconie would in turn move to 6 Music while Whiley's Radio 1 show would be taken over by Huw Stephens.

In March 2012 the BBC announced that as part of the broadcaster's celebration of the 20th anniversary of Britpop Whiley and Lamacq would present a week of ''Evening Sessions'' on Radio 2 from 7 April.

===Television career===
Whiley backstage on 23 June 2011
Whiley presents televised coverage of major music festivals such as the Glastonbury Festival. She also narrated the BBC Three series ''Little Angels''. In October 2007 she became a judge on the T4 (Channel 4) show ''MobileAct Unsigned'' which searches for a band trying to get a record deal. Jo has recently begun hosting a music TV show on music channel TMF. From late 1998 Whiley hosted her own music discussion show on Channel 4 called ''The Jo Whiley Show'' which ran for four series until late 2001.

On 15 March 2010 Whiley presented an edition of the ''Panorama'' documentary strand titled ''Are the Net Police Coming for You?'' in which she looked at the Digital Economy Bill a proposed new law targeting people who download music illegally from the Internet.

718625,American Missionary Association,Reconstruction,"
The AMA's pace of founding schools and colleges increased during and after the war.  Freedmen historically free blacks and white sympathizers alike believed that education was a priority for the newly freed slaves.  Altogether ""the AMA founded more than five hundred schools and colleges for the freedmen of the South during and after the Civil War spending more money for that purpose than the Freedmen's Bureau of the federal government.""

Among the eleven colleges they founded were Berea College and Atlanta University (1865); Fisk University (1866); Hampton Institute (1868) and Tougaloo College (1869); Dillard University Talladega College LeMoyne/LeMoyne-Owen College Tillotson/Huston-Tillotson University and Avery Normal Institute (1867) (now part of the College of Charleston).  Together with the Freedmen's Bureau the AMA founded Howard University in Washington D.C. in 1867. 
In addition the AMA organized the Freedmen's Aid Society which recruited northern teachers for the schools and arranged to find housing for them in the South.

In the mid-1870s however the Association ""pronounced black suffrage a failure and the freedmen ungrateful for the organization's many efforts on their behalf.""

By the 1870s the AMA national office had relocated to New York City.  Its magazine ''American Missionary'' had a circulation of 20000 in the 19th century ten times that of the abolitionist William Garrison's magazine.  The Cornell University Library has editions from 1878-1901 accessible online in its ''Making of America'' digital library.

While the AMA became notable in the United States with its work in opposition to slavery and in support of education for freedmen it also worked in missions in numerous nations overseas.  The 19th-century missionary effort was strong in India China and east Asia.

Over time the association became most closely aligned with the Congregational Christian Churches.  Most of those congregations have become members of the United Church of Christ (UCC).  The AMA maintained its distinct identity until 1999 when a restructuring of the UCC merged it into the Justice and Witness Ministries division.

The records of the American Missionary Association are housed at the Amistad Research Center located at Tulane University in New Orleans.

569131,Organ pipe mud dauber,Introduction,"


The '''organ pipe mud dauber''' (''Trypoxylon politum'') is a type of wasp in the family Crabronidae. They are fairly large wasps shiny black with pale hind tarsi. Male organ pipe mud daubers are among the few male wasps of any species to stay at the nest. A male ""stands guard"" (to prevent theft of prey or nest materials as well as to ward off parasites) while a female is away collecting spiders. Mating typically occurs on her visits to the nest. They typically build their nests in sheltered locations and large aggregations may form with dozens to hundreds of nests in a small area.

Organ pipe mud daubers are also an exceedingly docile species of wasp and generally pleasant to have around as they serve to keep spider populations down.  They sting the spiders commonly orb weavers to paralyze them then deposit them into nests as food for the growing larva.  Stings to humans are very rare bordering on non-existent. However if squeezed organ pipe mud daubers will sting in self-defense. There are a great many other species in the genus ''Trypoxylon'' (over 700 worldwide) mostly smaller in size and less abundant.

Jordan Cronk of ''Slant Magazine'' wrote that the film ""may be a willfully enigmatic even obtuse viewing experience but every frame continues to vibrant with energy and thrum with life"" and gave the film a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars. Mike D'Angelo of ''The A.V.

Others will be entranced"".

In the book ''101 Horror Films You Must See Before You Die'' author and professor at Brunel University Tanya Krzyminska called the film ""an exquisitely crafted fairy tale woven around the sexual awakening of a young woman"". Krzyminska also noted that although the film shared many similarities with soft-core pornographic films of the period ""it seeks a broader canvas in a blend of attributes drawn from both high and low culture."" Krzyminska also noted the film's elements of gothic horror and fairy tales as well as its use of symbolic imagery.

 is a 1987 beat 'em up video game developed by Technōs Japan and distributed in North America and Europe by Taito. The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up ''Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun'' (released outside of Japan by Taito as ''Renegade'') but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. ''Double Dragon'' is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.

Originally an arcade game home versions were released for the NES Master System Atari 2600 Atari 7800 Atari ST Amiga Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 Game Boy Genesis/Mega Drive and Atari Lynx among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled ''Double Dragon Advance'' was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The NES version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console on April 28 2008 in North America at a cost of 500 Wii Points. Nintendo also released the Game Boy version on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2011.

In 1972 he ran out of fuel but was towed through the infield which resulted in his disqualification. In the 1968 race he ran the last front engined car to date in the race.  He attempted to qualify a front engined car for the Indy 500 every year from 1975 to 1981 but failed to do so in each of those years.  On May 21 1972 on ""bump day"" he put his Miller Beer sponsored car in line to make a qualification attempt shortly before the closing deadline of 6:00 PM.  The time expired before it was his turn to qualify.  He then removed the engine cover to reveal that the car had no engine but five chilled cases of his sponsor's product which he shared with the other pit crews and race officials. In 1978 he did not meet the certified speed and was denied an attempt to make the race. He sat in Bob Harkey’s car and locked the brakes. He then ran on the track until he was apprehended by the police.
Hurtubise drove the last front engined car the Mallard/Offy in an IndyCar race at Michigan in 1972 qualifying 26th (last) and finishing 23rd. He drove the same car a year earlier at the Pocono 500 qualifying 33rd (last) and finishing 30th.

440643,83 Leonis,Stellar system,"
The primary component '''83 Leonis A''' is a 6th magnitude star. It is not visible to the unaided eye but easily visible with small binoculars. The star is classified as a subgiant meaning that it has ceased fusing hydrogen in its core and started to evolve towards red gianthood.

The secondary component '''83 Leonis B''' is an 8th magnitude orange dwarf somewhat less massive (0.88 MSun) smaller and cooler than the Sun. It is visible only with binoculars or better equipment. Components A and B share common proper motion which confirms them as a physical pair. The projected separation between the stars is 515 AU but the true separation may be much higher.

There is yet another magnitude 14.4 component listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog. However this star is moving into a different direction and is therefore not a true member of the 83 Leonis system.

797728,Leonard Pennario,Introduction,"'''Leonard Pennario''' (July 9 1924 – June 27 2008) was an American classical pianist and composer.

He was born in Buffalo New York and grew up in Los Angeles attending Los Angeles High School remaining in L.A. for his entire career.  He first came to notice when he performed Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto at age 12 with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.  The scheduled performer had fallen ill and Pennario's piano playing had come to the attention of the conductor Eugene Goossens who recommended him as the soloist after being assured by Pennario that he knew the work.  In fact he had never seen the music or even heard it but he learned it in a week.

He studied with Guy Maier Olga Steeb and Isabelle Vengerova and attended the University of Southern California where he studied composition with Ernst Toch. World War II interrupted his career and he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces in the China Burma India Theater where his piano skills were soon realized and served well entertaining troops of the Air Transport Command operation known as ""The Hump"".  He occasionally had to play around keys missing from the keyboards of the pianos at a couple of the more remote bases. He was discharged in 1946 as a staff sergeant and was awarded three Battle Stars.  He had however made his debut in uniform with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall on November 17 1943 with Artur Rodziński playing Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1.

Shortly after Sergei Rachmaninoff's death the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos invited Leonard Pennario to be the soloist at a memorial concert playing the Second Piano Concerto with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra.  Pennario became the first pianist after the composer himself to record all four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini''.  His recording of the Rachmaninoff 2nd Concerto was used for the film ''September Affair'' (1950) in which Joan Fontaine plays a concert pianist preparing to play the concerto.  
  
Beginning in the 1960s he played in a renowned trio with the violinist Jascha Heifetz and the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. Miklós Rózsa wrote a piano concerto for Pennario and he was the soloist in the first performance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta.

Pennario recorded over 60 LPs most of them of composers dating from Chopin and later. He is perhaps best known for championing certain modern composers such as George Gershwin Rachmaninoff Rózsa Louis Moreau Gottschalk and Sergei Prokofiev.  In 1958 he was tied with Walter Gieseking in terms of best-selling classical records involving the piano.

Pennario retired from active performance and recording in the 1990s.  He wrote some pieces of his own such as ''Midnight on the Cliffs'' ''March of the Lunatics'' and a 4-hand arrangement of Chopin's ''Minute Waltz''.

He was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame in October 2007.

As well as being well represented in music encyclopedias he was a Life Master in tournament bridge and is listed in The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge most notably winning an Open Pairs event in China in 1991.  He was once part of a celebrity foursome with Don Adams Les Brown and Jack Benny's daughter Joan Benny.

He died of complications from Parkinson's disease on June 27 2008 at the age of 83 in La Jolla California.

An authorized biography of Leonard Pennario is currently being written by ''Buffalo News'' music critic Mary Kunz Goldman.

3390,Crochet,Modern practice and culture,"Fashions in crochet changed with the end of the Victorian era in the 1890s. Crocheted laces in the new Edwardian era peaking between 1910 and 1920 became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.

The strong Victorian colours disappeared though and new publications called for white or pale threads except for fancy purses which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I far fewer crochet patterns were published and most of them were simplified versions of the early 20th-century patterns. After World War II from the late 1940s until the early 1960s there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts particularly in the United States with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies potholders and other home items along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included wonderful variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.

Although crochet underwent a subsequent decline in popularity the early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and DIY as well as great strides in improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. There are many more new pattern books with modern patterns being printed and most yarn stores now offer crochet lessons in addition to the traditional knitting lessons. There are many books you can purchase from local book stores to teach yourself how to crochet whether it be as a beginner or intermediate.  There are also many books for children and teenagers who are hoping to take up the hobby. 
Filet crochet Tunisian crochet tapestry crochet broomstick lace hairpin lace cro-hooking and Irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method.

Crochet has experienced a revival on the catwalk as well.  Christopher Kane's Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection makes intensive use of the granny square one of the most basic of crochet motifs.  In addition crochet has been utilized many times by designers on the popular reality show ''Project Runway''. Even websites such as Etsy and Ravelry have made it easier for individual hobbyists to sell and distribute their patterns or projects across the internet.

Laneya Wiles released a music video titled ""Straight Hookin'"" which makes a play on the word ""hookers"" which has a double meaning for both ""one who crochets"" and ""a prostitute.""

417980,18 (British Board of Film Classification),Introduction,"

18 category symbol
18 certificate (cinema) symbol (Irish Film Classification Office)
The '''18 certificate''' is issued by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to state that in its opinion a film video recording or game should not be seen in a cinema or purchased by a person under 18 years old.

As with other British film certificates the 18 certificate theoretically only has advisory power for films shown in public cinemas with the ultimate say being held by local authorities. In practice the local authorities tend to follow BBFC rulings in all but a few exceptional cases.

For video and game sales the BBFC rulings have statutory power as under the terms of the 1984 Video Recordings Act all videos sold or distributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC unless they fall into one of a number of exempt categories. Uncertificated recordings which are not exempt cannot legally be sold regardless of content.

The 18 certificate was created in 1982 as the successor of the previous X certificate which in turn was the successor of the H certificate (with H standing for ""horror""). See History of British Film Certificates for more details.

Typical reasons for restricting films to the 18 certificate category have included scenes of hard drug use supernatural horror explicit sex sadistic violence and sexual violence — the latter two of which have in the past led to a certificate not being issued at all in effect banning the film in the UK.

It was only around the start of the 21st century that the censors passed films with explicit ('hardcore') sexual acts despite the 18 certificate existing for many years.

It is also issued by the Irish Film Classification Office.

Marine mammals include five breeding species of seal; the southern elephant seal Australasian fur seal subantarctic fur seal Antarctic fur seal and the rare New Zealand sea lion 95% of the world's population of which breed on the Auckland Islands. 

There are also large numbers of breeding penguins and other seabirds including almost half of the world's species of albatross especially the world's only breeding colonies of the Antipodean albatross (''Diomedea exulans antipodensis'') southern royal albatross (''Diomedea epomophora epomophora'') Campbell albatross (''Thalassarche impavida'') white-capped albatross (''Thalassarche steadi'') and Salvin's albatross (''Thalassarche salvini''). The large colonies of Salvin's albatross on the Bounty Islands build nests of feathers as there is no vegetation to use. There are also isolated populations of land birds that have presumably settled here having been blown off course by ocean winds. Many of these have since evolved into unique species including two endemic parakeets on Antipodes Island; the Antipodes parakeet (''Cyanoramphus unicolor'') and Reischek's parakeet (''Cyanoramphus hochstetteri'').

318775,Currach,History,"Reconstruction of a 1 AD skin-covered boat on the Great Ouse in Bedford

The currach represents one of two traditions of boat and shipbuilding in Ireland: the skin-covered vessel and the wooden vessel. The flimsy construction of the former makes it unlikely that any remains would be available for the marine archaeologist but its antiquity is clear from written sources.

One of these is the Latin account of the voyage of St Brendan (who was born c. 484 in the southwest of Ireland): ''Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis''.  This contains an account of the building of an ocean-going boat: using iron tools the monks made a thin-sided and wooden-ribbed vessel ''sicut mos est in illis partibus'' (“as the custom is in those parts”) covering it with hides cured with oak bark. Tar was used to seal the places where the skins joined. A mast was then erected in the middle of the vessel and a sail supplied. Though the voyage itself is essentially a wonder-tale it is implied that the vessel as described was built in accordance with ordinary practice at the time. An Irish martyrology of the same period says of the Isle of Aran that the boat commonly used there was made of wickerwork and covered with cowhide.

Gerald of Wales in his Topographia Hibernica (1187) relates that he was told by certain seamen that having taken refuge from a storm off the coast of Connacht they saw two men long-haired and scantily clad approaching in a slender wickerwork boat covered in skins. The crew found that the two spoke Irish and took them on board whereupon they expressed amazement never before having seen a large wooden ship.

The consistency in accounts from the early Middle Ages to the early modern period makes it likely that the construction and design of the currach underwent no fundamental change in the interval.

A 17th-century account in Latin by Philip O'Sullivan Beare of the Elizabethan wars in Ireland includes a description of two currachs built in haste to cross the River Shannon. The larger was constructed as follows: two rows of osiers were thrust in the ground opposite each other the upper ends being bent in to each other (''ad medium invicem reflexa'') and tied with cords whereupon the frame so made was turned upside down. Planks seats and thwarts were then fitted inside (''cui e solida tabula statumina transtraque interius adduntur'') horse hide was fixed to the exterior and oars with rowlocks were supplied. This vessel is described as being able to carry 30 armed men at a time.

326008,Spirit Caravan,Biography,"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich formed Spirit Caravan after the breakup of The Obsessed. The remainder of the band consisted of Dave Shermann (formerly of Wretched) on bass and vocals; and Gary Isom (formerly of Unorthodox) on drums. Weinrich credits them for encouraging him to join the band and become active musically again after he had abandoned his music career. The band was originally entitled Shine and they released a demo and 7"" under this name. They were forced to change to the band's name when another band of the same name threatened legal action. They changed their name to Spirit Caravan after an Obsessed song. The band had a lyrical emphasis on spirituality (though not necessarily religion) and global politics. The band split up in 2002 but have reunited for US tour dates and European festival appearances in 2014.

After the band's demise Weinrich joined Place of Skulls and founded The Hidden Hand. After The Hidden Hand's demise in 2007 Weinrich rejoined the reactivated Saint Vitus. Sherman went on to found the band Earthride. Isom joined Internal Void Pentagram Valkyrie and Nitroseed.

Their song ""Dove-Tongued Aggressor"" was featured on the Tony Hawk's American Wasteland soundtrack.

Numerous songs by Spirit Caravan were also recorded as songs for The Obsessed. ""Kill Ugly Naked"" from Jug Fulla Sun appears on various demos and live recordings along with the ""Incarnate"" compilation. ""Fear's Machine"" from Jug Fulla Sun was originally written for the Obsessed and appears on the ""Incarnate"" compilation. ""Melancholy Grey"" from Jug Fulla Sun was written in the same sessions as 1994's ""The Church Within"" and appears on the 2013 reissue of that album.""Higher Power"" from Dreamwheel appears on the Obsessed's 1982 demo. ""Spirit Caravan"" from Elusive Truth appears on ""Incarnate"". ""Lifer City"" from Elusive Truth appears on various demos and the unreleased Obsessed LP sent to Metal Blade.

Former Obsessed drummer Ed Gulli will be joining Spirit Caravan on drums for the Maryland Doom Fest in June 2015. He was replaced in 2016 by drummer Brian Costantino.

Wino announced in 2016 that Spirit Caravan would become the new lineup of The Obsessed.

In classical mechanics '''Euler's rotation equations''' are a vectorial quasilinear first-order ordinary differential equation describing the rotation of a rigid body using a rotating reference frame with its axes fixed to the body and parallel to the body's principal axes of inertia. Their general form is:

:

where ''M'' is the applied torques ''I'' is the inertia matrix and ω is the angular velocity about the principal axes.

In 3D principal orthogonal coordinates they become:

:

where ''Mk'' are the components of the applied torques ''Ik'' are the principal moments of inertia and ω''k'' are the components of the angular velocity about the principal axes.

Rice Village has been one of Houston's oldest shopping destinations since 1938. It is an unplanned high density hodge-podge of old and new retail stores.

David Kaplan of ''Cite'' wrote that during the 1950s and 1960s Rice Village ""filled up and prospered"" but the economic boom in Greater Houston in the 1970s caused development to come elsewhere. He credited the influx of young families in Southgate and Southampton in Houston and the City of West University Place beginning in the 1980s to revitalizing Rice Village.

In the mid-1980s Rice University began buying land in the Rice Village area. Scott Wise the university's vice president for investments stated in 1996 that Rice Village is ""strategically located"" and allows possible growth and flexibility.

The first minutes of the 1994 film ''The Chase'' were filmed in the Rice Village.

1837,British National Party,Introduction,"




The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in Wigton Cumbria and its current leader is Adam Walker. A minor party it currently has one councillor in UK local government. During its heyday in the 2000s it had over fifty seats in local government one seat on the London Assembly and two Members of the European Parliament.

The BNP was formed in 1982 by John Tyndall and other former members of the National Front (NF). By Tyndall's admission it remained ideologically identical to the NF and took its name from that of a defunct 1960s party. During its first two decades the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections in which it did poorly but rather focused on street marches and rallies. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership and in 1999 ousted him. The new leader Nick Griffin sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by moderating some of its policies targeting concerns about rising immigration rates and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being ousted in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically and members had split to form rival groups like Britain First and the English Defence League.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme or far-right of British politics the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall's leadership it was more specifically regarded as Neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist and it espouses the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and the removal of settled non-white populations from the country. Initially it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites although it has since advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory calling for global racial separatism and condemning mixed-race relationships. Under Tyndall the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial although Griffin switched the party's focus on to Islamophobia. It promotes economic protectionism Euroscepticism and a transformation away from liberal democracy while its social policies oppose feminism LGBT rights and societal permissiveness.

The BNP has a highly centralised structure that gives its chairman near total control. It established a range of sub-groups—such as a youth wing record label and trade union—and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history the BNP attracted most support from within White British working-class communities in Northern and Eastern England particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. More widely it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from anti-fascists religious organisations and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members were banned from a number of professions and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured the party's criminalization.

442669,Guardian Building,History,"The skyscraper was built by the Union Trust Company founded in Detroit in 1890 by Senator James McMillan and Dexter M. Ferry along with investments from Russell A. Alger Col. Frank J. Hecker and Christian H. Buhl. During World War II the Guardian Building served as the U.S Army Command Center for war time production. The Guardian served various tenants as an office building in downtown Detroit. In 1982 it became the headquarters of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (""MichCon"") subsequent to the divestiture of MichCon by ANR Company in 1981. Under the leadership of President and COO Stephen E. Ewing MichCon restored the lobby and vaulted ceilings on the first floor in 1986.  It would stay MichCon's later to be called MCN Energy Group headquarters until the merger of MCN with DTE Energy in 2001. It was sold by DTE to a local real estate developer the Sterling Group in 2002.

The Sterling Group invested $14 million in the building and reopened the lobby to the public which had only been accessible to employees after MichCon purchased the building.
 
On July 18 2007 Wayne County Executive Robert Ficano announced it has entered into an agreement to purchase the Guardian Building to relocate its offices from the Wayne County Building. The deal was reportedly part of a larger deal worth $33.5 million in real estate purchases in downtown Detroit. The Guardian Building has become a souvenir item along with other Detroit skyscrapers.

455711,Holland Tunnel fire,Injuries and damage,"
In total 66 people were injured mostly by smoke inhalation. Of these 27 were hospitalized.  One firefighter (Battalion Chief Gunther E Beake) was severely affected by smoke inhalation and died of his injuries on 23 August 1949.

The truck carrying carbon disulfide was completely destroyed as were nine other trucks.  13 trucks were damaged.

The infrastructure suffered extensive damage.  Approximately 650 short tons (590 tonnes) of rubble were removed during the weekend before the tunnel reopened.

The tiles on the tunnel walls spalled off for a distance of approximately 200 feet (60 m) west of the fire site and 500 feet (150 m) east of it.  At the site of the fire the concrete lining of the walls spalled down to the ribs of the cast-iron primary lining.

The false ceiling above the roadway which consisted of a  insitu reinforced concrete slab collapsed completely in several places and collapsed partially over a length of approximately 500 feet (150 m).

The elevated side walkway had to be renewed over a length of 750 feet (230 m) and the cable ducts cast into the walkway and walls were replaced over 300 feet (90 m).

Damaged power cabling communications cabling and lighting were all renewed over the damaged area.  The road surface was renewed over a length of about 500 feet (150 m).

The Port Authority decided that the tunnel could not be closed completely for the duration of the reconstruction.  Instead the south tube was closed at 8 p.m. each night after which hundreds of feet of mobile scaffold and other equipment was hauled in.  Reconstruction work was carried out overnight until approximately 4:30 a.m. at which time the construction equipment and scaffold was hauled out before the tunnel re-opened at 6 a.m.  The repairs were completed by mid-August 1949.

3167,Classical order,Historical development of the orders,"The St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor Ionic at the second floor Corinthian at the third floor
The Tower of The Five Orders at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University completed in 1619 includes Tuscan through Composite orders.
The Renaissance period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''De architectura'' by Roman theoretician architect and engineer Vitruvius is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan Doric Ionic and Corinthian) he uses in fact various words such as: ''genus'' (gender) ''mos'' (habit fashion manner) ''opera'' (work).

The term ''order'' as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome at the beginning of the 16th century probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi Raphael and Sangallo.
Ever since the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects from Renaissance and Baroque periods basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists with Doric characterized as bold and manly Ionic as matronly and Corinthian as maidenly.

13894,Sikhism,Prohibitions in Sikhism,"
Some prohibitions include:

#Cutting hair: Cutting hair is forbidden in Sikhism for those who have taken the Amrit initiation ceremony. These Amritdhari or Khalsa Sikhs are required to keep unshorn hair.
#Intoxication: Consumption of alcohol non-medicinal drugs tobacco and other intoxicants is forbidden in Sikhism according to the ""Sikh Rahit Maryada"". A Khalsa Amritdhari Sikh who consumes any intoxicant is considered ''patit'' lapsed and may be readmitted into Khalsa only if re-baptised. In contrast Nihangs of Sikh tradition who protect Sikh shrines wearing visible and ready weaponry along with their notable blue turbans practice meditation with the aid of cannabis. Regular Sikhs in practice however socially consume some alcohol while smoking has been historically infrequent among Sikhs.
#Priestly class: Sikhism does not have priests but does have liturgical service which employs people for a salary to sing hymns (Kirtan) officiate an Ardās Puja or marriage and perform services at a Gurdwara. Any Sikh can become a Granthi to look after the Guru Granth Sahib and any Sikh is free to read from the Guru Granth Sahib.
#Eating meat : Both initiated and uninitiated Sikhs are strictly prohibited from eating meat from animals slaughtered by halal method known as Kutha meat where the animal is killed by exsanguination (via throat-cutting). According to Eleanor Nesbitt the general issue of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism is controversial within Sikhism and contemporary Sikhs disagree. The ban on ''kutha meat'' along with ban on any sexual relations with Muslims and a ban on smoking habit common among 18th-century Indian Muslims states Nesbitt was a part of Sikh Guru's efforts to socially isolate Muslims. Amritdhari Sikhs or those baptised with the ''Amrit'' have been strict vegetarians abstaining from all meat and eggs. Sikhs who eat meat seek the Jhatka method of producing meat believing it to cause less suffering to the animal. The uninitiated Sikhs too are not habitual meat-eaters by choice and beef (cow meat) has been a traditional taboo. Typically meat is not served in community free meals such as langar.
#Adultery is forbidden.

DuPont de Nemours & Co. and The Rockefeller Foundation. In 2002 he was awarded competitively a Breast Cancer Concept Award by the U.S. Department of Defense as recommended by the Congressionally-directed Medical Research Programs.
He has published over thirty peer-reviewed original research articles  (Google Scholar) in the specialty of mitochondrial bioenergetics and molecular biology.

His largest contribution to biochemistry and cell biology was to demonstrate that the mitochondrial hexokinase is the enzyme responsible for driving the high rates of glycolysis that occur under aerobic conditions characteristic of rapidly growing malignant tumor cells. Since then aerobic glycolysis by malignant tumors is utilized clinically to diagnose and monitor treatment responses of cancers by imaging uptake of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose (a radioactive modified hexokinase substrate) with positron emission tomography (PET).

In 2005 he published a research article that demonstrates that the functional association of glucokinase (a hexokinase isoform) to mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular signaling of apoptosis in normal liver is actually not mediated by a physical association of this enzyme with mitochondria or either their inner membrane or outer membrane as proposed by others.

704407,Amarantine (album),Recording and music,"After the release of her box set ''Only Time – The Collection'' in November 2002 Enya took several months off from writing recording and releasing music. She resumed in September 2003 to start work on ''Amarantine'' her first studio album since her commercially successful 2000 release ''A Day Without Rain''. She worked with her longtime recording partners producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife lyricist Roma Ryan. Recording took place at Aigle Studio a facility installed at the Ryan's home in Killiney County Dublin in Ireland. Enya adopted a five-day working schedule to work on the album working from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and taking weekends off. The album was dedicated to BBC producer Tony McAuley who commissioned Enya to compose the soundtrack to the 1987 BBC documentary series ''The Celts'' which was subsequently released as her debut album ''Enya'' (1987). McAuley died in June 2003.

The album was Enya's first of her career not to include a song sung in Gaelic her first language. ""Amarantine"" was a love song of which its title is a word that Enya said addresses the idea of everlasting and love. Roma had used the word in ""Flora's Secret"" on ''A Day Without Rain'' which in its lyric was spelled ""amaranthine"". In her notes about the song Roma wrote the track is ""a song of sadness"" adding: ""for how else can one describe such sorrow? Not knowing where a loved one is not knowing how they are not knowing how to find them"". The idea of returning home after a long journey was what ""Long Long Journey"" was written about and is a theme Enya has covered across her career. The lyrics to ""Sumiregusa"" were inspired by hokku the opening stanza to the Japanese form of poetry renga and renku written by the poet Matsuo Bashō who once felt his heart leap ""at the sight of a wild violet"". The theme of sadness was revisited on ""Someone Said Goodbye"" a song about one reflecting on life which at times may bring on sad feelings. ""A Moment Lost"" addressed two ideas: the regretful feeling of words spoken at times of anger by a loved one that leave a mark on one's heart and a song of love that in turn heals it and forgives. ""Drifting"" was an instrumental piece that developed from a piano melody typical of Enya's other instrumental tracks. According to Roma ""Amid Falling Snow"" was inspired by a child's amazement of seeing snowfall for the first time and Christmas time in general.

''Amarantine'' featured Enya singing in two new languages for the first time. ""Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)"" is sung in Japanese of which its opening bars is taken from an arrangement of the hymn ""Hark! The Vesper Hymn is Stealing"" by the Irish composer John Andrew Stevenson. The album also marked the creation of Loxian a fictional language created by Roma Ryan during the development of ""Water Shows the Hidden Heart"". The track tells the story of a man who is looking ""whom he loves and has lost"" and the emotions he experiences. Attempts to sing the song with a set of English Gaelic and Latin lyrics did not provide results strong enough causing Roma to suggest the idea of a new language inspired by the fictional Elvish languages by author J. R. R. Tolkien that she had used Enya's song ""May It Be"" and ""Aníron"" for ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (2001) and the wordless sounds Enya made while singing to the songs she was working on in the studio. Roma said she created words for Enya's voice so ""so the poetry of the lyrics sit on the curves of the music"" and initially named it Errakan. The idea was a success which led its name changed to Loxian and Roma creating a culture and history behind it that concerned the Loxians a race of another planet who question the existence of life on another. Enya took a liking to the language and sung ""Less Than a Pearl"" and ""The River Sings"" in Loxian. Roma described the latter track as a song whereby the Loxians ""send their words out into the night ... expressing their quest to discover if they are alone in the universe"". In December 2005 Roma released a book about Loxian titled ''Water Shows the Hidden Heart''.

418712,Kawasaki Ki-45,Operational history,"Kawasaki Ki-45 KAIc Army Type 2 Two-seat fighter Model C of the 53rd Hiko Sentai
The Ki-45 was initially used as a long-range bomber escort. The 84th Independent Flight Wing (Dokuritsu Hikō Chutai) used them in June 1942 in attacks on Guilin where they encountered but were no match for Curtiss P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers. In September of the same year they met P-40s over Hanoi with similar results. It became clear that the Ki-45 could not hold its own against single-engine fighters in aerial combat.

It was subsequently deployed in several theaters in the roles of interception attack (anti-ground as well as anti-shipping) and fleet defense. Its greatest strength turned out to be as an anti-bomber interceptor as was the case with the Bf 110 in Europe. In New Guinea the IJAAF used the aircraft in an anti-ship role where the Ki-45 was heavily armed with one 37 mm (1.46 in) and two 20 mm cannons and could carry two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs on hard points under the wings. 1675 Ki-45s of all versions were produced during the war.

The first production type (''Ko'') was armed with two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine gun in the nose a single Type 97 20 mm cannon in the belly offset to the right and a trainable 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun in the rear cabin; this was followed by the ''Otsu'' with the lower 20 mm cannon replaced by a 37 mm (1.46 in) type 94 tank gun to counter B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. While the firepower was devastating manual reloading meant that typically only two rounds could be fired on each gunnery pass. The next type (''Hei'') restored the 20 mm cannon and this time placed an automatic 37 mm (1.46 in) gun in the nose. A later addition in the ""Tei"" type were twin obliquely-firing 20 mm Ho-5 cannons behind the cockpit and often propulsive exhaust stacks.

Soon after entering service the Ki-45 was assigned to home defense and several were dispatched against the Doolittle raid though they did not see action. The craft's heavy armament proved to be effective against the B-29 Superfortress raids which started in June 1944. However its performance was insufficient to counter B-29s flying at 10000 m (32800 ft). Modifications such as reduction of fuel and ordnance were attempted to raise performance to little avail and in the end aircraft were used effectively in aerial ramming attacks.
They were also used in ''kamikaze'' attacks such as the attack on USS  on 2 April 1945 off Okinawa. The commanding officer and 54 crew were killed when a Toryu clipped the stacks from astern and rammed the bridge. A second Toryu hit the foredeck opening a 7 m (23 ft) hole in the deck. The ensuing fires demolished the ship and after the surviving crew was rescued by fellow fast transports and ex-destroyers  and  the ship was towed out to sea and scuttled. 
Remains of the only surviving Ki-45 KAIc on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly Virginia with Schräge Musik type vertical cannon mount behind the cockpit
In 1945 the forward and upward-firing guns showed some results with the commencement of night time bombing raids but the lack of radar was a considerable handicap. By the spring of 1945 the advent of American carrier-based fighters and Iwo Jima-based P-51s and P-47s escorting B-29s over the skies of Japan brought the Ki-45's career to an end.

The next version the '''Kawasaki Ki-45 KAId''' was developed specifically as a night fighter which were supposed to be equipped with centimetric radar in the nose; due to production difficulties this did not occur. The aircraft took part in night defense of the Home Islands and equipped four ''sentais'' from the autumn of 1944 to the war's end. They obtained notable successes and one Ki-45 ''sentai'' claimed 150 victories including eight USAAF B-29 Superfortresses in their first combat.

The Ki-45 was to be replaced in the ground-attack role by the Ki-102 but was not wholly supplanted by the war's end.

Three Ki-45s fell into communist Chinese hands after World War II. Unlike most captured Japanese aircraft which were employed in the training role the three Ki-45s were assigned to the 1st Squadron of the Combat Flying Group in March 1949 and were used in combat missions. These aircraft were retired in the early 1950s.

As an African-American novel and historical artifact ''Incidents'' constituted a critical intervention into the early African-American literary canon and African-American historiographies of slavery by foregrounding the experiences of black women under slavery. Before black feminist challenges to the African-American literary and historiographic canons in the 1970s and '80s the former and the latter foregrounded themes of slavery racism social inequality and black cultural resistance but failed to highlight the specific exigencies faced by black women under slavery; namely institutionalized rape and reproductive violence. Thus ''Incidents'' along with other black women's novels and historiographies directed critical attention to the ways in which race and gender interacted in the lives of black bondswomen to produce gender-specific conditions of unfreedom.

140247,Philip Schuyler,Career,"===Early career===
From 1761 to 1762 Schuyler made a trip to England to settle accounts from his work as quartermaster. He began construction on his home in Albany later called Schuyler Mansion during this time. He also began construction of his country estate (now known as the General Schuyler House) at Saratoga.

In 1768 Schuyler began his political career as a member of the New York Assembly serving in that body until 1775. During that time his views came to be more opposed to the colonial government particularly in matters of trade and currency. He was made a colonel in the militia for his support of Governor Henry Moore.

===Revolutionary War===
Letter from Philip Schuyler to Israel Shreve 1776
Schuyler was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775 and served until he was appointed a Major General of the Continental Army in June. General Schuyler took command of the Northern Department and planned the Invasion of Canada (1775). His poor health required him to place Richard Montgomery in command of the invasion.

As department commanding General he was active in preparing a defense against the Saratoga Campaign part of the ""Three Pronged Attack"" strategy of the British to cut the American Colonies in two by invading and occupying New York State in 1777. In the summer of that year General John Burgoyne marched his British army south from Quebec over the valleys of Lakes Champlain and George.   On the way he invested  the small Colonial garrison occupying Fort Ticonderoga at the nexus of the two lakes.  When General St. Clair abandoned Fort Ticonderoga in July the Congress replaced Schuyler with General Horatio Gates who had accused Schuyler of dereliction of duty.

====Battle of Saratoga====
The British offensive was eventually stopped by Continental Army then under the command of Gates and Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Saratoga. That victory the first wholesale defeat of a large British force marked a turning point in the revolution for it convinced France to enter the war on the American side. When Schuyler demanded a court martial to answer Gates' charges he was vindicated but resigned from the Army on April 19 1779. He then served in two more sessions of the Continental Congress in 1779 and 1780.

Schuyler was an original member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

===Later career===
After the war he expanded his Saratoga estate to tens of thousands of acres adding slaves tenant farmers a store mills for flour flax and lumber. His flax mill for the making of linen was the first one in America. He built several schooners on the Hudson River and named the first ''Saratoga''.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1780 to 1784 and at the same time New York State Surveyor General from 1781 to 1784. Afterwards he returned to the State Senate from 1786 to 1790 where he actively supported the adoption of the United States Constitution.

In 1789 he was elected a U.S. Senator from New York to the First United States Congress serving from July 27 1789 to March 3 1791. After losing his bid for re-election in 1791 to Aaron Burr he returned to the State Senate from 1792 to 1797. In 1797 he was elected again to the U.S. Senate and served in the 5th United States Congress from March 4 1797 until his resignation because of ill health on January 3 1798.

""'''C-Chute'''"" is a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov.  It was first published in the October 1951 issue of ''Galaxy Magazine'' and later appeared in Asimov's collections ''Nightfall and Other Stories'' (1969) and ''The Best of Isaac Asimov'' (1973).

One of the few Asimov stories that feature aliens the story deals with a group of people imprisoned by an alien race when their spaceship is captured. The emphasis of the story is on the interactions and group psychology of the prisoners all of whom have differing backgrounds and motivations.

An argument between Asimov and the editor Horace L. Gold over this story was the inspiration for Asimov's story ""The Monkey's Finger"".

267566,Sonny Boy Williamson I,Name issues,"His legacy has been somewhat overshadowed in the postwar blues era by the popularity of the musician who appropriated his name Rice Miller who after Williamson's death went on to record many popular blues songs for Chicago's Checker Records and others and toured Europe several times during the blues revival in the 1960s.
The recordings made by Williamson between 1937 and his death in 1948 and those made later by Rice Miller were all originally issued under the name Sonny Boy Williamson. It is believed that Miller adopted the name to deceive audiences (and his first record label) into thinking that he was the ""original"" Sonny Boy. In order to differentiate between the two musicians many later scholars and biographers have referred to John Lee Williamson (1914–1948) as Sonny Boy Williamson I and Miller (c. 1912–1965) as Sonny Boy Williamson II.

To add to the confusion around 1940 the jazz pianist and singer Enoch Williams recorded for Decca under the name Sonny Boy Williams and in 1947 as Sunny Boy in the Sunny Boy Trio.

===Death's Head===
Death's Head's first appearance after ''High Noon Tex'' was in the ''Transformers'' seeing him attempt to claim the bounty that Rodimus Prime had placed on Galvatron's head travelling back in time to the 1980s in pursuit of his quarry. Realising the error he had made in placing the bounty Rodimus followed him back and stopped him from destroying Galvatron forcibly returning him to the future. Subsequently Death's Head was contracted by the Decepticons to take out Rodimus Prime a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure. However Rodimus outsmarted him and instead paid him to terminate Cyclonus and Scourge. Over the course of the next year Death's Head pursued them eventually confronting them on the Planet of Junk where they all fell under the mental control of Unicron.

Death's Head tried to resist the control but was manipulated into killing Shockwave only to eventually help Rodimus Prime seal Unicron within the Matrix. Finally prevented from escaping the scene by the explosions wracking the area Death's Head forced himself Cyclonus and Scourge through Unicron's time portal vowing to kill them ""another time"".  However in the course of the time travel they became separated and while Cyclonus and Scourge wound up on Cybertron in the past eventually joining with Scorponok and becoming Targetmasters Death's Head instead encountered the Time Lord known as the Doctor. As a matter of self-defense The Doctor shrank him to human size and shot him off through time. He arrived on Earth in the year 8162 leading to an encounter with the future government's troubleshooting team Dragon's Claws where he was heavily damaged in an explosion and buried under a collapsing building.

Death's Head was recovered by the Chain Gang and rebuilt (with a redesigned body) by one of their members Spratt. In exchange for this rescue he confronted Dragon's Claws again on the Chain Gang's behalf defeating and capturing Scavenger. When the Claws came to recover their missing member Death's Head defeated Dragon - but opted not to kill him instead walking away and stating that his chronometer was ""a minute slow"" and his contract had therefore expired. The Chain Gang were arrested and Spratt who had escaped arrest opted to join Death's Head.

Death's Head and Spratt then relocated to the Los Angeles Resettlement where Death's Head once again went into business as a Freelance Peacekeeping Agent. Death's Head was later hired to capture the Doctor and his TARDIS which led him to being stuck in the present day (where he confronted the ''Fantastic Four'') and then sent by Reed Richards to the year 2020 (where he met the Iron Man of that era and gave him friendly advice on mercenary work). The series was ended abruptly with a cliffhanger at issue 10 due to the closure of Marvel UK's own creative team.

In 1990 the ongoing storyline was resolved in the Marvel UK ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'' story which was serialized in the magazine ''Strip'' before being reprinted in the Marvel Graphic Novel format. In this story Death's Head was becoming worried that he was starting to enjoy killing and was prolonging missions for fun rather than simply doing it for money. In addition Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex a psychotic who hunted beings for sport and stole their bodies upon killing them. However a woman named Pyra who wished to steal Lupex' secrets ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. She gave it a cold and calculating business-like mind but before it could be used against Lupex the body was stolen by an unknown party enlarged to the size of the Cybertronians and catapulted through time. Death's Head was used as a pawn by Pyra who wished to get him to a point where he could kill Lupex while Lupex had begun to hunt Death's Head with the intention of gaining his body. Driven to his mental limits and nearly killed he eventually was able to kill Lupex and refusing to be anything like his ""father"" killed him quickly while declaring he ""kills ''only'' for profit or survival!"".

Around this time Death's Head's also made a few appearances in some US Marvel comics most notably the ''Fantastic Four'' (where he was hired by the Time Variance Authority) ''She-Hulk'' (where he resigned from the TVA) and ''Marvel Comics Presents''.

In the final issue (#12) of ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' the Doctor claims to have been responsible for sending Death's Head to the Transformers Universe. Despite being a manipulative being especially in his seventh incarnation it could be that this claim is false. There is nothing else within Death's Head's history to substantiate this claim.

====2010's Death's Head====

Death's Head appears in the first five issues of the ''S.W.O.R.D.'' ongoing series hunting down Abigail Brand's brother. He was given a partial redesign with his head having some elements from the Minion version and is his original giant size. He is not using the term ""freelance peacekeeper"" until the Beast suggests it to him and Death's Head notes that he likes it and he doesn't appear to be a time/dimensional traveler. This seems to indicate this is Death's Head ''before'' he met the Transformers and the human-sized Bryan Hitch model Death's Head would appear separately in other comics.

In an ''Iron Man'' run by the same writer he was hired by the alien race Voldi to face Tony Stark in a gladiator-like trial by combat; afterwards Stark hired him to help track down the Voldi's killer Unit 451. (Death's Head asked if he was one of ""those guys who has a code against killing ""except for robots""? I ''hate'' those krypto-fascists."") Unfortunately for Stark 451 had hired the peacekeeper first and he led him into a trap (and returned Stark's fee). He passed up Stark's offer to double 451's fee as ""a mech has to have ethics yes?""

When Doctor Octopus was masquerading as the Superior Spider-Man he had to battle Death's Head; the Time Variance Authority had sent the mercenary to kill the Future Foundation. Octavius found a way around this.

====Enemies and associates====

*'''Spratt''' - an enthusiastic and barely-tolerated young sidekick who rebuilt Death's Head for the Chain Gang then assumed the role of his partner. Following Death's Head's assimilation by Minion Spratt recovered the body and tried to rebuild Death's Head once again. He was aided in this by Baron Strucker IV but was betrayed and killed by the Strucker-Charnel amalgam.
*'''Dragon's Claws''' - a team of government-sponsored enforcers who twice clashed with Death's Head. The first instance interceding when he was battling one of their targets The Jones Boys resulted in Death's Head being heavily defeated. On the second occasion a newly-rebuilt Death's Head captured one of the Claws Scavenger and defeated the others who came to rescue him but chose to spare them on a technicality.
*'''The Seventh Doctor''' - the TARDIS collided with Death's Head as he was being expelled from the Transformers' Universe. The Doctor shrunk the Transformer-scale Death's Head to human size using a Tissue Compression Eliminator then sent him to 8162. Death's Head was subsequently hired to kill The Doctor but was betrayed by his employer and did not complete the contract. The Doctor later claimed to be the 'unknown party' that originally stole Death's Head from his creators Lupex and Pyra and sent him into the Transformers Universe hoping to shape his adventures for good.
*'''Big Shot''' - a rival bounty hunter from 8162. Tall muscular and with a cannon replacing his right arm Big Shot was originally hired by a gangland boss The Undertaker to avenge the death of his Plague Dog creature. After a bitter defeat Big Shot's enmity became personal. He was manipulated by Pyra and sent to 2020 to confront the mechanoid where he almost succeeded in killing Death's Head.

===Death's Head II===
Mark Brooks.

Eventually after many undocumented adventures Death's Head was beheaded and his personality ""assimilated"" into the mind of the cyborg Minion. Minion was a cyborg created by Dr. Evelyn Necker a long-term pet project created after years of research which included the Xandarian Worldmind being temporarily uploaded into the Minion program's gestalt matrix. By the year 2020 she was an employee of AIM and the final Minion (as well as its prototype Death Wreck) was designed to protect the organisation from a psychically predicted threat; it killed and assimilated the minds of multiple targets as preparation for this!"".

Death's Head's personality overwhelmed Minion's programming before it could take out its final target (Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four) and they became the gestalt lifeform that called itself Death's Head II. Death's Head II was partnered with Tuck an artificial human from the pseudo-medieval planet of Lionheart where humans had outlawed advanced technology and waged war against androids and cyborgs. Neo-Nazi black mage Baron Strucker IV would magically combine himself with the original Death's Head's corpse to become the supervillain Charnel a recurring enemy for Death's Head II and the threat AIM had predicted.

With other assimilated personalities mingling with that of the ""freelance peacekeeper"" Death's Head changed as a character becoming a more heroic and far less amoral figure than the original as well as losing his unique mannerisms. He hopped across time and realities in many adventures often fighting for the greater good; in one adventure he volunteered for a heroic sacrifice whereas before he'd have required payment. He encountered many Marvel characters including the Fantastic Four X-Men Spider-Man the Hulk and Cable and crossed over with almost every Marvel UK character who was published at the time.

The original Death's Head was only ever seen again in flashbacks or within Death's Head II's gestalt mind as well as the twelve-issue ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' limited series (which reprinted various Death's Head stories from the past with a new framing sequence) in which Death's Head and Death's Head II join forces to defeat a servant of an enemy of the original Death's Head.

Death's Head appeared briefly in the final issue of the ''Captain Britain and MI13'' ongoing series as one of the MI13 reserves battling against an army of vampires on the moon. Whereas the other Marvel UK characters reintroduced in the issue were accompanied with captions explaining their long absences from the Marvel Universe (e.g. ""Back from space"") Death's Head was captioned as ""Just... back!"" and given the line ""Surprise appearance yes?!"".

In 2010 Death's Head II was shown as a resident of a possible future in ''Avengers'' #2; this appearance also featured as one of the issue's alternative covers.

In the ''Days of Future Past'' timeline Death's Head II was part of Britain's Resistance Coordination Executive. Seen as indestructible he became a symbol of their resolve until he was murdered in battle.

Death's Head II's design was created by artist Liam Sharp and he was primarily scripted by Dan Abnett.

Death's Head II titles included the four-issue introductory mini-series a sixteen-issue ongoing series and ''Death's Head II Gold'' a second mini-series (written by Liam Sharp) that was cancelled after the first issue.

====""What If Death's Head I Had Lived?""====
In issue #54 of the ''What If'' (vol. 2) series Simon Furman and Geoff Senior wrote and drew a tale showing Death's Head surviving Minion's attack and later killing the cyborg; something Furman has said was ""deeply satisfying and cathartic"". Death's Head rebuilt his injured body into a larger more heavily armed form; meanwhile the Minion cyborg went on to kill Reed Richards only to be possessed by Strucker and became Charnel itself. Evelyn Necker had to hire Death's Head to stop this threat.

Using a time machine Death's Head went back in time to gather the surviving Fantastic Four and several other superheroes offering them a shot at avenging Reed by ending Charnel - and then let them all get killed softening up Charnel for him. Using his firepower on Charnel and goading him at not using the full potential of his gestalt mind he got the cyborg to access these scientific minds - knowing this would allow Reed Richards' mind (still fighting within Charnel) to take control of the cyborg's motor functions allowing him to kill it. His mission complete Death's Head thought about the selfless non-profit nature of heroes: ""I just hope it's not catching yes?""

===Death's Head 3.0===
Cover to ''Amazing Fantasy'' (vol. 2) #16 featuring Death's Head 3.0. Art by Lucio Parillo.

The third version of Death's Head was introduced in a five-part storyline within the pages of Marvel's anthology series ''Amazing Fantasy'' beginning in #16 (December 2005). Written by Death's Head creator Simon Furman and drawn by James Raiz the story is set 100 years in the future and does not appear to be directly linked to the previous Death's Head stories.

Advanced Idea Mechanics are set to make peace with the UN and become a legitimate non-terrorist organisation. Hardliner AIM Senior Scientist Patricia Goddard has decided to stop the peace treaty and force AIM back underground by assassinating the UN Secretary General using a mysterious alien cyborg in AIM's possession codenamed Death's Head. Powered and given intelligence by an artificial variant on the Uni-Power the cyborg is sent out into the field with preprogrammed objectives but the clash between its murderous inclinations and an instinctive desire to help people leave it unsure what side it wants to be on.

The final panel of the Death's Head 3.0 story concludes with an image of the cyborg with mouth horns alluding to the original Death's Head. It is mentioned as now operating as a deniable troubleshooter for the GEIST organisation (Global Enforcement/Intelligence Symposium Taskforce) carrying out operations they cannot be officially involved in for political reasons. 
(Comic artist Simon Williams has said that Furman was going to end the story by having the character say ""I'm Death's Head yes?"" to set up that Death's Head 3.0 was an early version of the original but the ""yes?"" was cut off by the editor by mistake.)

This incarnation of Death's Head went on to appear on Sakaar during the ''Planet Hulk'' series. Similar models are used by the Hulk as soldiers during the ''World War Hulk'' event and one is used as an AIM courier in the ''MODOK's 11'' limited series by Monica Rappaccini.

It is shown during Nova's Secret Invasion Issues that the Hulk's Death's Head units have been handed over to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. for study by a Dr Necker under her ""Minion"" Project. After Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R. forces come in to shut the facility down it is revealed that Dr Necker is an A.I.M. double agent setting up how Death's Head was in A.I.M. possession during the Death's Head 3.0 miniseries.

More recently during the Enigma Force tie-in miniseries of the Incredible Hulks Dark Son arc it was revealed that this model of Death's Head were built in the Microverse during a war with K'ai thousands of years ago. Sometime after the war some of the warships they were aboard were sucked through the Great Portal of Sakaar which is said to breach time and space.

===Revolutionary War and all Death's Heads===
In 2014's ''Revolutionary War'' Death's Head II took a contract from Psycho-Wraith Prime to capture Captain Britain so that he could track where the villain's base was and find out if Mys-Tech were returning (and so he could have the money). When he was himself double-crossed and captured and handed to an earlier Evelyn Necker to be dissected he sent a failsafe signal to Tuck to hire the earlier Death's Head—this one human-sized rather than the Transformer-sized version in contemporary settings - and come to his rescue. (""Hrm. That's me? Bio-organic? Droopy horns? ''No cape?!'' You're right -- I really ''do'' need saving!"") After a brief fight the two of them tore through an army of Death's Head 3.0's but were defeated and the original Death's Head was captured  to be used to create a portal to Hell. Both Death's Heads and Tuck fought against Mephisto's armies gunning down the demonic Killpower. Afterwards they departed to discuss the future.

The ''Death's Head'' one-shot had multiple references to the character's history and fan views: Necker controlled Death's Head II and sicced him on the original as in ''Death's Head II'' #1 only for the original to stab him though the head and remark ""the past always catches up with you yes?""; Necker decided on the name ""Minion"" after getting DH2 under control and told him she'd see him again in 2020; and both characters are dismissive of the Death's Head 3.0's sharing their name remarking ""you can't beat the ''real thing''"".

With the outbreak of World War II in 1941 the city received federal money again plus the city approved local financing to improve the airport again with the costs of the improvements totaling around $600000. During and after flooding along the Columbia River in 1948 the Hillsboro facility was used by some commercial operators due to the closure of then Portland-Columbia Airport (now Portland International) which lies along the river. The three commercial carriers at Hillsboro were Coastal Airways Columbia Air Cargo and General Air Cargo. This was the flooding that wiped out the city of Vanport and due to that disaster relief supplies were flown into the Portland area by the United States Air Force using the Hillsboro Airport.

The field was also considered as a possible Naval air station in 1946 and again in 1955 but was eventually rejected by the Navy. In early 1960 several companies were located at the airport including Tektron Instruments and Georgia Pacific. In 1964 the Hillsboro City Council made an official request to the Port of Portland to take over ownership of the airport. The facility had been deteriorated due to inadequate funding and the Port agreed to take over ownership after some legal wrangling in 1965. Then on August 28 1966 an air traffic control tower was opened after construction costs of $400000 with staffing by the FAA. Next in April 1975 the current main terminal that includes offices and a restaurant opened followed by the opening of the new  runway on September 1 1976. 

A Horizon Air plane was hijacked on May 2 1986 en route from Eugene to Portland with the pilot able to convince the hijacker to allow the plane to land at HIO where the hijacker was arrested. In 1989 customs call out service was added to allow international business flights at the airport after lobbying by Congressman Les AuCoin and business leaders. After advance notice customs inspectors from Portland were sent to the airport to process the passengers.

Hillsboro airport is often mentioned as a reliever airport for Portland International Airport. In 1999 Portland City Council member Dan Saltzman suggested expanding the Hillsboro Airport to relieve pressure on the busy Portland International Airport. This was during a time when the Port of Portland was discussing building a new larger airport or possibly adding a third runway to PDX to handle growing demand for air travel and air cargo. Saltzman suggested shifting some commercial flights to Hillsboro while shifting some cargo flights there had previously been discussed.

As of 2006 the Port of Portland planned to spend $134 million through 2025 to improve the Hillsboro facility. Plans call for a third runway increased hangar space and additional automobile parking on-site among other items. Construction on the third runway was to begin as early as 2010 but legal challenges put the plan on hold. In 2007 a staffed customs office was added to the airport. Paid for by funds generated by a user-fee association this allowed the airport to continue as a port of entry and removed the need for a Customs officer to travel from Portland International Airport.

The airport handled 259263 flights in 2008 surpassing Portland International in this category. In 2009 the airport received a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to expand taxiways as part of the airport's master plan. President Barack Obama landed at the airport in Marine One in February 2011 as part of a visit to nearby Intel. The Port spent $9 million to repave the 2/20 runway and combined two taxiways into a single one in 2013. Construction started on the third runway in June 2014. Nike founder Phil Knight built a personal hangar at the airport next to the Nike hangar in 2014 while Global Aviation added a new hangar that same year. The third runway was eventually built opening in April 2015.

33801,Wensleydale cheese,References in culture,"
In his essay ""In Defence of English Cooking"" George Orwell rates Wensleydale as second only to Stilton among British cheese varieties.

Wensleydale was one of the cheeses named by John Cleese in the Monty Python sketch ""The Cheese Shop"" which originally appeared in a 1972 episode of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''. In addition the shop owner played by Michael Palin was named 'Henry Wensleydale' which caused some confusion between the two when the cheese was mentioned.

In the 1990s sales of Wensleydale cheese had fallen so low that production was at risk of being suspended. However the popular Wallace and Gromit animated shorts ''A Grand Day Out'' ''The Wrong Trousers'' and ''A Close Shave'' had the main character Wallace a cheese connoisseur mention Wensleydale as a particularly favourite cheese. Animator Nick Park chose it solely because it had a good name that would be interesting to animate rather than due to its origins in northern England where the shorts were set. He was also unaware of the financial difficulties that the company was experiencing. The company contacted Aardman Animations about a licence for a special brand of ""Wallace and Gromit Wensleydale"" which proved to be an enormous success. When the 2005 full-length Wallace and Gromit film ''Curse of the Were-Rabbit'' was released sales of Wensleydale cheeses increased by 23%.

111069,Pyotr Stolypin,Prime minister,"Stolypin by Ilya Repin

After two months Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov suggested the absent-minded Goremykin ought to step down and promoted a cabinet with only Kadets which in his opinion would soon enter into a violent conflict with the Tsar and fail. He secretly met with Pavel Milyukov. Trepov opposed Stolypin who promoted a coalition cabinet. Georgy Lvov and Alexander Guchkov tried to convince the tsar to accept liberals in the new government.

When  Goremykin according to S. Witte a bureaucratic nonentity resigned on  Nicholas II appointed Stolypin also as Prime Minister while he continued as Minister of Interior an unusual concentration of power in Imperial Russia. He dissolved the Duma despite the reluctance of some of its more radical members in order to facilitate government cooperation. In response 120 Kadet and 80 Trudovik and Social Democrat deputies went to Vyborg (then a part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and thus beyond the reach of Russian police) and responded with the Vyborg Manifesto (or the ""Vyborg Appeal"") written by Pavel Milyukov. Stolypin allowed the signers to return to the capital unmolested.

Stolypin's wooden villa after the attempted assassination. One third was blown to pieces.

On 25 August 1906 three assassins from the Union of Socialists Revolutionaries Maximalists wearing military uniforms bombed a public reception Stolypin was holding at his dacha on Aptekarsky Island. Stolypin was only slightly injured by flying splinters but 28 others were killed. Stolypin's 15-year-old daughter was heavily wounded; his 3-year-old son was slightly wounded standing with his sister on the balcony. Stolypin moved into the Winter Palace. In October 1906 at the request of the Tsar Grigori Rasputin paid a visit to the wounded child.

Stolypin changed the nature of the Imperial Duma to attempt to make it more willing to pass legislation proposed by the government. After dissolving the Second Duma on 8 June 1907 (Coup of June 1907) 15 Kadets who had been in contact with terrorists were arrested; he changed the weight of votes more in favor of the nobility and wealthy reducing the value of lower class votes. The leading Kadets were ineligible. This affected the elections to the Third Duma which returned much more conservative members more willing to cooperate with the government. It changed Georgy Lvov from a moderate liberal into a radical.

Distribution of newly formed farms in Grodno governorate (1909)

In Saratov Stolypin had come to the conviction that the open field system had to be abolished. Like in Denmark he introduced land reforms in order to resolve peasant grievances and quell dissent. Stolypin's reforms aimed to stem peasant unrest by creating a class of market-oriented smallholding landowners. He was assisted by Alexander Krivoshein 1908 becoming the Minister of Agriculture. He aimed to create a moderately wealthy class of peasants that would support societal order. (See article ""Stolypin's Reform""). He tried to improve the lives of urban laborers and worked towards increasing the power of local governments but the zemstvos adopted an attitude hostile to the government.




Since 1905 Russia was plagued by revolutionary unrest and discontent was widespread among the population. With broad support leftist organizations waged a violent campaign against the autocracy; throughout Russia many police officials and bureaucrats were assassinated. ""Stolypin inspected rebellious areas unarmed and without bodyguards. During one of these trips somebody dropped a bomb under his feet. There were casualties but Stolypin survived."" To respond to these attacks Stolypin introduced a new court system of martial law that allowed for the arrest and speedy trial of accused offenders. Over 3000 (possibly 5500) suspects were convicted and executed by these special courts between 1906 and 1909. In a Duma session on 17 November 1907 Kadet party member Fedor Rodichev referred to the gallows as ""Stolypin's efficient black Monday necktie"". As a result Stolypin challenged Rodichev to a duel but the Kadet party member decided to apologize for the phrase in order to avoid the duel. Nevertheless the expression remained as did ""Stolypin car"".

Stolypin attempted to improve the acrimonious relations between Russian Orthodox and Jewish citizens at the level of nationalities policy. Sergey Sazonov was the brother-in-law of Stolypin and did his best to further his career; in 1910 he became Minister of Foreign Affairs following Count Alexander Izvolsky. Around 1910 the press started a campaign against Rasputin who was said to have paid too much attention to young girls and women. Stolypin wanted to ban him from the capital and threatened to prosecute him as a sectarian. Rasputin went on a trip to Jerusalem and came back to St. Petersburg only after Stolypin's death.

""Stolypin resigned in March of 1911 from the fractious and chaotic Duma after the failure of his land-reform bill"". He had proposed spreading the system of zemstvo to the southwestern provinces of Russia. It was originally slated to pass with a narrow majority but Stolypin's political opponents stopped it. Tsar Nicholas II decided to look for a successor to Stolypin and considered Sergei Witte Vladimir Kokovtsov and Alexei Khvostov.

318069,Sevanavank,Introduction,"

'''Sevanavank''' (; meaning ''Sevan Monastery'') is a monastic complex located on a peninsula at the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan in the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia not far from the town of Sevan.  Initially the monastery was built at the southern shore of a small island.  After the artificial draining of Lake Sevan which started in the era of Joseph Stalin the water level fell about 20 metres and the island transformed into a peninsula. At the southern shore of this newly created peninsula a guesthouse of the Armenian Writers' Union was built. The eastern shore is occupied by the Armenian president's summer residence while the monastery's still active seminary moved to newly constructed buildings at the northern shore of the peninsula.

Due to easier accessibility (once it became a peninsula) good highway and railway connections with the Armenian capital Yerevan a well-developed tourist industry in the nearby town of Sevan and its picturesque location (although less picturesque than it was before the lake level drop) Sevanavank is one of the most visited tourism sights in Armenia.

Size-consistency means that the energy of two non-interacting (i.e. at large distance apart) molecules calculated directly will be the sum of the energies of the two molecules calculated separately. This method called QCISD was developed in the group of John Pople. It gives results that are comparable to the coupled cluster method CCSD. QCISD can be improved by the same perturbative inclusion of unlinked triples to give QCISD(T). This gives similar results to CCSD(T).

207519,Cædwalla of Wessex,Introduction,"
'''Cædwalla'''  (c. 659 – 20 April 689) was the King of Wessex from approximately 685 until he abdicated in 688. His name is derived from the British Cadwallon. He was exiled from Wessex as a youth and during this period gathered forces and attacked the South Saxons killing their king Æthelwealh in what is now Sussex. Cædwalla was unable to hold the South Saxon territory however and was driven out by Æthelwealh's ealdormen. In either 685 or 686 he became King of Wessex. He may have been involved in suppressing rival dynasties at this time as an early source records that Wessex was ruled by underkings until Cædwalla.

After his accession Cædwalla returned to Sussex and won the territory again and also conquered the Isle of Wight engaging in genocide extinguishing the ruling dynasty there and forcing the population of the island at sword point to renounce their pagan beliefs for Christianity. He gained control of Surrey and the kingdom of Kent and in 686 he installed his brother Mul as king of Kent. Mul was burned in a Kentish revolt a year later and Cædwalla returned possibly ruling Kent directly for a period.

Cædwalla was wounded during the conquest of the Isle of Wight and perhaps for this reason he abdicated in 688 to travel to Rome for baptism. He reached Rome in April 689 and was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter dying ten days later on 20 April 689. He was succeeded by Ine.

263589,Siding,Composite siding,"Composite siding in clapboard form being installed.
Various composite materials are also used for siding: asphalt shingles asbestos fiber cement aluminium (ACM) fiberboard hardboard ''etc.'' They may be in the form of shingles or boards in which case they are sometimes called clapboard.

Composite sidings are available in many styles and can mimic the other siding options. Composite materials are ideal for achieving a certain style or 'look' that may not be suited to the local environment (e.g. corrugated aluminium siding in an area prone to severe storms; steel in coastal climates; wood siding in termite-infested regions).

Costs of composites tend to be lower than wood options but vary widely as do installation maintenance and repair requirements. Not surprisingly the durability and environmental impact of composite sidings depends on the specific materials used in the manufacturing process.

Fiber cement siding is a class of composite siding that is usually made from a combination of cement cellulose (wood) sand and water.  They are either coated or painted in the factory or installed and then painted after installation. Fiber cement is popular for its realistic look durability and fire resistance.  Composite siding products containing cellulose (wood fibers) have been shown to have problems with deterioration delamination or loss of coating adhesion in certain climates or under certain environmental conditions.

A younger class of non-wood synthetic siding has sprouted in the past 15 years. These products are usually made from a combination of non-wood materials such as polymeric resins fiberglass stone sand and fly ash and are chosen for their durability curb appeal and ease of maintenance. Given the newness of such technologies product lifespan can only be estimated varieties are limited and distribution is sporadic.

Helmer at an event in Brussels in 2008
In September 1998 following his selection as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the East Midlands Helmer left his job as Managing Director of a Leicester textile company Donisthorpe Ltd (the UK subsidiary of a French textile multinational) to campaign full-time ahead of the 1999 euro-elections and took up his new role as an MEP immediately after his election.

He was re-elected as a Conservative MEP for the East Midlands Region in 2004. 
He was suspended from the Conservative Party whip on 26 May 2005 after voting against party instructions on a motion to censure the European Commission and openly criticising his delegation leader Timothy Kirkhope in a parliamentary debate; the Conservative party whip was restored on 13 September 2006 but he remained ''Non-Inscrit''. He joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) with the other Conservative MEPs in July 2009.

Having initially advocated the Conservative policy of renegotiating the EU treaties since 2006 he has been a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign calling for the UK to leave the EU.

He was appointed Adam Smith Scholar in 2005 by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

He became Chairman of the libertarian pressure group The Freedom Association in April 2007.

In November 2009 he stepped down as the Conservative party's spokesman on employment in the European parliament because he thought the Conservatives' new policy on not supporting a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty was ""confused"" and ""essentially cosmetic"".

===UKIP===
On 12 October 2011 Helmer announced that he would resign from the European Parliament at the end of the year citing ""increasing disillusion with the attitudes of the Conservative Party"" as the main reason although admitting that his ""twelve-and-a-half years banging my head against the same brick wall in Brussels is perhaps long enough"".

Helmer expected to be replaced by Rupert Matthews who was next on the Conservative party list in the 2009 European Parliament election. However the party was reported to be looking into golliwog dolls featuring on the front cover of a book published by a company of which  Matthews is director and shareholder and would not confirm that Matthews would succeed him.

Helmer delayed standing down before it was announced on 2 March 2012 that he had defected from the Conservatives to the UK Independence Party. He faced accusations of hypocrisy as he had demanded in November 2000 that MEP Bill Newton Dunn immediately resign as a result of his move from Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats.

On 6 April 2014 Helmer visited the congress of Conservative People's Party of Estonia in Tallinn and gave a speech in support of Euroscepticism in Estonia.

On 6 May 2014 it was announced on the official UKIP website that Helmer would contest the Newark by-election following the resignation of former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer. He came second with 25% behind the Conservative Robert Jenrick who received 45% of the vote.

On 25 May 2014 he was re-elected for UKIP as the first on their list for the East Midlands seat in the 2014 European Elections.

Helmer is the UKIP spokesman on Energy and Industry. He argues that current green energy initiatives are making British business less competitive and costing jobs.

Their first book was ''Anything Can Happen'' (1945) which recounted Papashvily's experiences as a penniless immigrant. Originally published in a serialized format in ''Common Ground'' and ''Direction'' magazines this book was co-selected for the Book of the Month Club and was a best-seller selling more than 600000 copies in the U.S. and 1.5 million worldwide. It was translated into 15 foreign languages including Georgian (in 1966). It was made into a movie in 1952 starring Jose Ferrer as George and Kim Hunter as Helen. Papashvily died in 1978 in Cambria California.

222332,The Second Coming (poem),Influence,"Phrases and lines from the poem are used in many works. Several novels songs TV episodes and albums draw their title from ""The Second Coming"" (e.g. Chinua Achebe's 1958 novel ''Things Fall Apart'' and Joan Didion's 1968 essay collection ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem''). A 2016 analysis by Factiva showed that lines from the poem were quoted more often in the first seven months of 2016 than in any of the preceding 30 years in the context of political turmoil after the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's election with commentators repeatedly invoking its lines: ""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.""

120723,Andrew Clements,Life,"Clements grew up in Camden New Jersey and Springfield Illinois US. As a child he enjoyed summers at a lakeside cabin in Maine where he spent his days swimming hiking water skiing and his evenings reading books. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from Northwestern University and a Masters of Arts in Elementary Education from National Louis University he worked as a teacher sharing his love of reading with elementary middle and high school students. (During his senior year at Springfield High School his English teacher handed back a poem he’d written.  Two things were amazing about that paper.  First he’d gotten an A—a rare event in this teacher’s class.  And she’d also written in large scrawny red writing “Andrew—this poem is so funny.  This should be published!”  -Andrew Clements)  

He started his literary career by writing songs. Then he worked for several publishing companies where he published acquired edited marketed and developed quality children's books. In 1985 Clements added his own work to the market with a picture book entitled ''Bird Delbert''. His first novel was the award-winning ''Frindle'' which has won sixteen state book awards as well as the Christopher Award.

Clements lives in Maine with his wife Rebecca and has four sons- John Nathaniel George and Charles. George and Charles are in the new acoustic bluegrass group The Lonely Heartstring Band.

397663,Moneen,History,"The band formed in 1999 after the dissolution of another band called Perfectly Normal. Moneen's original bass player Mark Bowser was replaced by Chris Slorach (Nu Chris) who left the band after the release of ''The Theory of Harmonial Value''. Erik Hughes (who played bass for the band on their first Canadian tour) later became the permanent bass player for the band.

The band recorded their first EP ""Smaller Chairs for the Early 1900s"" in Kenny's basement. They then re-released it on Smallman Records with their second album ""The Theory of Harmonial Value"" the band's next release was ""Are We Really Happy with Who We Are Right Now"" in 2003. They later signed to Vagrant Records. Smallman Records still distributes their albums in Canada. In 2005 they released a split EP with friends Alexisonfire on Dine Alone Records on which each band covered two of the other's songs plus one original song.

In 2005 director Alex Liu followed the band through the recording process for ''The Red Tree'' filming a documentary entitled ''The Start to This May Be the End to Another''. ''The Red Tree'' was released on April 11 2006 on CD and vinyl. The vinyl release of The Red Tree was limited to 300 copies. On April 21 of 2012 Moneen will re-pressed The Red Tree on vinyl limited once again to 500 copies.  The documentary was released as part of ''The Moneen DVD: It All Started with a Red Stripe'' on May 13 2008. The DVD had been nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of The Year.

In March 2008 Moneen parted ways with their drummer Peter Krpan who decided to start a solo project named One Grand Canyon and acquired new drummer Steve Nunnaro as a permanent replacement. In the same announcement the band revealed they are nine songs into their upcoming record.

Moneen began recording their fourth studio album ''The World I Want to Leave Behind'' in December 2008 which was released September 15 2009 with Dine Alone Records. They released it on CD and vinyl. The vinyl release had a bonus track called ""Dark & Ugly"".

In 2010 Peter Krpan re-joined Moneen as the permanent drummer. Recently the band opened for several dates on Alexisonfire's farewell tour in December 2012 however the band had performed very little throughout 2012 and continuing into 2013 without officially announcing the future of the band.

Chris Erik and Peter formed a new band in 2013 named Seas and signed a deal with Black Box Music.  They have been touring since.  Kenny plays in a band called Cunter and is the guitar tech for The Sheepdogs

23757,Turnip,Human use,"Macomber turnip historic marker

Pliny the Elder considered the turnip one of the most important vegetables of his day rating it ""directly after cereals or at all events after the bean since its utility surpasses that of any other plant"". Pliny praised it as a source of fodder for farm animals noting that this vegetable is not particular about the type of soil in which it grows and because it can be left in the ground until the next harvest it ""prevents the effects of famine"" for humans.

The Macomber turnip (actually a rutabaga) dating from the late 19th century features in one of the very few historic markers for a vegetable on Main Road in Westport Massachusetts.

In England around 1700 Turnip Townshend promoted the use of turnips in a four-year crop-rotation system that enabled year-round livestock production.

In most of England the smaller white vegetables are called turnips while the larger yellow ones are referred to as swedes. In the USA turnips are the same but swedes are usually called rutabagas. In Scotland Ireland parts of northern England and parts of Canada the usage varies and is sometimes confusingly reversed with the yellow vegetables being called turnips or neeps and the white ones swedes. Neeps are mashed and eaten with haggis traditionally on Burns Night.

Turnip lanterns are an old tradition; since inaugural Halloween festivals in Ireland and Scotland turnips (rutabaga) have been carved out and used as candle lanterns. At Samhain candle lanterns carved from turnips — ''samhnag'' — were part of the traditional Celtic festival. Large turnips were hollowed out carved with faces and placed in windows used to ward off harmful spirits. At Halloween in Scotland in 1895 masqueraders in disguise carried lanterns made out of scooped-out turnips.

In Nordic countries turnips provided the staple crop before their replacement by the potato in the 18th century. The cross between turnip and cabbage rutabaga was possibly first produced in Scandinavia.

In Turkey particularly in the area near Adana turnips are used to flavor ''şalgam'' a juice made from purple carrots and spices served ice cold. In Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon turnips are pickled.

In Japan pickled turnips are sometimes stir-fried with salt or soy sauce.  Turnip greens are included in the ritual of the Festival of Seven Herbs called ''suzuna''.

In the United States stewed turnips are eaten as a root vegetable in the autumn and winter.  The greens of the turnip are harvested and eaten all year.  Turnip greens may be cooked with a ham hock or piece of fat pork meat the juice produced in the stewing process prized as pot liquor. Stewed turnip greens are often eaten with vinegar.

In the Friuli region of Italy a popular side dish called ''brovada'' is made of shredded turnip marinated in red grape pomace.

In Iran boiled turnip-roots (with salt) are a common household remedy for cough and cold.

In the Punjab and Kashmir regions of India and Pakistan turnips are used in variety of dishes most notably ''Shab Degh''.

In Brazil turnips () are traditionally regarded as distasteful or at least somewhat disagreeable and unpleasant at the first bite or taste. Part of this bias reportedly stems from the Middle Ages where for the reason of being inexpensive turnips became in Iberia (and thus in Iberian-descended cultures) associated with the poor and avoided in the diet of the nobility.
"
35032,Salisbury,Name,"The name Salisbury which is first recorded around the year 900 as ''Searoburg'' (dative ''Searobyrig'') is a partial translation of the Roman Celtic name ''Sorviodūnum''. Brittonic ''*-dūnon'' meaning ""fortress"" (in reference to the fort that stood at Old Sarum) was replaced by its Old English equivalent ''-burg''. The first part of the name is of obscure origin. The form ""Sarum"" is a Latinization of ''Sar'' a medieval abbreviation for Middle English ''Sarisberie''.

The two names for the city Salisbury and Sarum are humorously alluded to in a 1928 limerick from ''Punch'':



Salisbury appeared in the Welsh ''Chronicle of the Britons'' as ''Caer-Caradog'' ''Caer-Gradawc'' and ''Caer-Wallawg.'' Cair-Caratauc one of the 28 British cities listed in the ''History of the Britons'' has also been identified with Salisbury.

595117,Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet),Plot summary,"
===Act 1===

Goodnight Desdemona begins with a ""dumb show"" or a scene with no sound in which three situations occur simultaneously. Othello murders Desdemona Juliet and Romeo kill themselves and Constance Ledbelly throws a pen and a manuscript into a wastebasket.

In scene 1 Constance works on her doctoral dissertation which claims that ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Othello'' were originally comedies written by an unknown author and that this can be proved by decoding a manuscript written by an alchemist named Gustav. Her longtime crush Professor Claude Night comes in criticizes her dissertation topic and tells her that he is taking a job at Oxford University that she had hoped to secure. Constance laments her fate and begins throwing her possessions into the wastebasket until she herself is sucked into the wastebasket.

===Act 2===

The second act takes place on the island of Cyprus within the world of ''Othello''. During the scene where Othello resolves to kill his wife Constance intervenes and reveals that Iago is tricking Othello. Othello binds Iago and expresses his gratitude to Constance. Desdemona arrives and asks whether Constance may stay with them. Othello tells Constance not to make known to Desdemona that he was jealous of his wife. Constance asks Desdemona for help in her quest to discover who originally wrote Shakespeare's plays. Desdemona agrees and tells her to come to battle. Constance wonders whether she has permanently changed Shakespeare's work and resolves to find the ""Wise Fool"" a typical Shakespearean character who secures the happy ending of a comedy.

In scene 2 Iago discloses that he has a page from the Gustav manuscript and forms a plan to conspire against Constance. Constance bonds with Desdemona telling of her relationship with Professor Night while Iago eavesdrops. Constance describes the world of academia and her newfound feminist convictions. Desdemona encounters Iago carrying buckets of filth and Iago stirs jealousy in her. Desdemona believes Iago's claims that Constance is a witch who is after Othello's heart and she resolves to kill her!

Desdemona sees Othello give Constance a necklace and her suspicions increase. Constance muses about what a strong woman Desdemona is. Iago and Desdemona enter fighting with swords and Constance nearly kills Iago thinking that she is saving Desdemona. Iago shows Desdemona the page from the Gustav manuscript saying that he found it in Constance's underwear drawer. Desdemona shows it to Constance who confirms that it is hers. She reads its clue that she must seek truth in Verona Italy. Before Desdemona can kill her Constance is dragged offstage.

===Act 3===

Act 3 takes place within the context of ''Romeo and Juliet''. It begins with the scene in which Mercutio fights with Tybalt. Constance arrives and tackles Romeo to the ground before Tybalt can stab Mercutio under Romeo's arm. Romeo tells her ""Speak boy"" confusing her gender because Desdemona has ripped off Constance's skirt. Calling herself Constantine Constance explains that they should stop fighting because Romeo has married Juliet and they are all family now. They agree and Romeo falls in love with Constance. The men make lewd jokes and go to the bathhouses. Constance wishes that she could go back home.

In scene 2 Juliet and Romeo wake up together and describe their declining interest in each other. They fight over their turtle Hector and end up ripping it in two; they part on bitter terms. Juliet complains to her nurse that she is dying of boredom and wishes that she could be unmarried able to play the deadly game of love. The nurse tells her that she should cheer up because she will enjoy the marriage festivities that night and Juliet resolves to find another lover.

In scene 3 Constance pounces on a servant because she believes that he is the Wise Fool but she finds instead that he is giving out invitations to a masked ball thrown by Juliet's father. In scene 4 Romeo and Juliet enter the masked ball sulking at each other. Romeo thinks that Tybalt is Constance and puts his hand on Tybalt's bottom. Constance enters and Romeo tells her that he loves her. Tybalt sees Romeo kiss Constance and sends Juliet to interrupt them. Romeo introduces Constance to Juliet and Juliet falls in love with her.

Juliet dances with Constance while Romeo and Tybalt watch suspiciously. Tybalt resolves to kill Constance. Romeo decides to dress as a woman so that Constance will desire him and he cuts in to dance with her. Juliet sees them and determines to dress as a man so that Constance will desire her. Romeo and Juliet begin to fight over Constance and Constance tells them to apologize.

In scene 5 Juliet enters dressed in Romeo's clothing and woos Constance from below her balcony. They discover that they have the same birthday. Constance resists Juliet and tells her of her bitterness about love. Juliet tells her that she knows the name of the Wise Fool and will trade it for one kiss. Romeo then enters in Juliet's clothing but Constance leaves before he can woo her.

Scene 6 takes place in the graveyard through which Constance walks on her way to Juliet's balcony. While she is there she sees a ghost like that of the King in Hamlet who tells her that the Wise Fool and the Author are the same ""lass"". The ghost disappears and Tybalt enters trying to kill Constance. Romeo steps between them and Constance escapes.

In scene 7 Juliet pulls Constance up to her balcony with a rope. They share a long kiss and then Juliet admits that she lied about knowing the name of the Wise Fool. Juliet tries to kill herself but Constance pins her down and reveals that she is a woman. Juliet exclaims that she loves her all the more. Constance claims that she is not a lesbian but Juliet convinces her that they should make love. Constance reaches under Juliet's shirt where she finds a page from the Gustav manuscript.

A warp effect brings Desdemona to the scene and she begins to smother Constance with a pillow. Juliet tries to save her and then goes to seek help. Constance holds up the necklace that Othello gave her which has a birthday inscription to Desdemona and Desdemona stops smothering her. Tybalt arrives and Constance pretends to be dead telling Desdemona to seek Juliet. In scene 8 Desdemona confuses Romeo for Juliet and tells him to meet them in the crypt.

Romeo who is still in Juliet's clothes has fallen for Desdemona. In scene 9 he invites her to lie with him in the crypt. Romeo confuses Tybalt for Desdemona however and Tybalt carries Romeo away thinking that he is a maiden. Juliet enters and starts to stab herself out of sorrow but Constance stops her and they embrace. Desdemona enters and starts to stab Juliet until Constance stops her. Desdemona then urges Constance to come to Cyprus while Juliet exhorts her to remain and die with her. Constance interrupts them and points out their faults. They promise to forgo their tragic impulses and Constance realizes that she is both the Author of the play and the Wise Fool. Constance is then transported by warp effect back to her office at Queen's University where she finds that her pen has turned to gold.

=== Imperata ===
''Imperata'' grasslands are caused by human activities such as logging forest clearing for shifting cultivation agriculture and grazing and also by frequent fires. The latter is a frequent result of human interference.  However when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances they regenerate naturally and speedily to secondary young forest. The time of succession in ''Imperata'' grassland  (for example in Samboja Lestari area) ''Imperata cylindrica'' has the highest coverage but it becomes less dominant from the fourth year onwards. While ''Imperata'' decreases the percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots ''Melastoma malabathricum Eupatorium inulaefolium Ficus'' sp. and ''Vitex pinnata''. strongly increase with the age of regeneration but these species are commonly found in the secondary forest.

Soil properties change during secondary succession in Imperata grassland area. The effects of secondary succession on soil are strongest in the A-horizon (0–10 cm) where an increase in carbon stock N and C/N ratio and a decrease in bulk density and pH are observed.  Soil carbon stocks also increase upon secondary succession from ''Imperata'' grassland to secondary forest.

=== Oak and hickory forest ===
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients however are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. Before the fire the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire though these trees are no longer dominant. Thus the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to at least in part changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species over many years shrubs will emerge along with small pine oak and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually over 150 years the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community which will remain stable until the next disturbance.

===Founding===
Balliol College – one of the university's oldest constituent colleges
The University of Oxford has no known foundation date. Teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096 but it is unclear when a university came into being. It grew quickly in 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris. The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188 and the first known foreign scholar Emo of Friesland arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201 and the masters were recognised as a ''universitas'' or corporation in 1231. The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.

After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209 some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge later forming the University of Cambridge.

The students associated together on the basis of geographical origins into two ""nations"" representing the North (''northerners'' or ''Boreales'' who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (''southerners'' or ''Australes'' who included English people from south of the Trent the Irish and the Welsh). In later centuries geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition members of many religious orders including Dominicans Franciscans Carmelites and Augustinians settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students. At about the same time private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham who in 1249 endowed University College and John Balliol father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name. Another founder Walter de Merton a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester devised a series of regulations for college life; Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.

In 1333–34 an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford Lincolnshire was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter until the 1820s no new universities were allowed to be founded in England even in London; thus Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly which was unusual in western European countries.

===Renaissance period===
In 1605 Oxford was still a walled city but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map)
The new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies and John Colet the noted biblical scholar.

With the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.

In 1637 William Laud the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury codified the university's statutes. These to a large extent remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866 membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and ""dissenters"" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.

The university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649) while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause. From the mid-18th century onwards however the University of Oxford took little part in political conflicts.

Wadham College founded in 1610 was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren. Wren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s the Oxford Philosophical Club which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the College's Warden John Wilkins and the group formed the nucleus which went on to found the Royal Society.

===Modern period===
====Students====
The curriculum at Oxford before the reforms was notoriously narrow and impractical.  Sir Spencer Walpole a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official had not attended any university.  He says ""few medical men few solicitors few persons intended for commerce or trade ever dreamed of passing through a university career.""  He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: ""The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons except those intended for the ministry."" Nevertheless Walpole argued: 
:Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was however one good thing about it and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another and full liberty to live their lives in their own way without evolving in the best among them some admirable qualities of loyalty independence and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning which was of any service to him he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself a reverence for the past a code of honour for the present which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate in the Church or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports in his studies and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.

Out of the students who matriculated in 1840 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers).  After graduation 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers).  After graduation 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).

M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.

At the start of 1914 the university housed about 3000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War many undergraduates and Fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all Fellows were in uniform and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent. The University Roll of Service records that in total 14792 members of the university served in the war with 2716 (18.36%) killed. Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces bearing the inscription 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914-1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals cadet schools and military training camps.

====Reforms====
Two high-powered parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait former headmaster of Rugby School was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students restrictions on entry should be dropped and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city instead of in a college.

The system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802 with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores. Schools of ""Natural Sciences"" and ""Law and Modern History"" were added in 1853. By 1872 the last of these had split into ""Jurisprudence"" and ""Modern History"". Theology became the sixth honour school. In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was and still is offered.

The mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845) led among others by the future Cardinal Newman. The influence of the reformed model of German universities reached Oxford via key scholars such as Edward Bouverie Pusey Benjamin Jowett and Max Müller.

Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests greater tolerance for religious dissent and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920 and Latin until 1960.

The University of Oxford began to award doctorates in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.

The mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars displaced by Nazism and communism relocating to Oxford.

The list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics the sciences medicine and literature. More than 50 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.

===Women's education===
Somerville College was founded as one of Oxford's first women's colleges in 1879. It is now fully co-educational.
The university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level; for a brief period in the early 1900s this allowed the ""steamboat ladies"" to receive ''ad eundem'' degrees from the University of Dublin. The first four women's colleges were established through the efforts of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (AEW). Lady Margaret Hall (1878) was followed by Somerville College in 1879; the first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop. The first two colleges for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886) St Hilda's (1893) and St Anne's College (1952). In the early 20th century Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations. On 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. However before the 1970s all Oxford colleges were for men or women only so that the number of women was limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.

In 1974 Brasenose Jesus Wadham Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.

In 2008 the last single-sex college St Hilda's admitted its first men so that all colleges are now co-residential. By 1988 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female; the ratio was about 46%:54% in men's favour for the 2012 undergraduate admission.

In June 2017 Oxford announced that starting the following academic year women and men at Oxford will be able to sit some exams at home to help women achieve the same first levels as men at Oxford.

The detective novel ''Gaudy Night'' by Dorothy L. Sayers herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford is largely set in a (fictional) women's college at Oxford and the issue of women's education is central to its plot.

196877,HMS Royal Oak (08),Design and description,"
Illustration of  as she appeared in 1916
The ''Revenge''-class ships were designed as slightly smaller slower and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. Still under construction the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by  over the original specification.

''Royal Oak'' had a length overall of  a beam of  and a deep draught of . She had a designed displacement of  and displaced  at deep load. She was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines each driving two shafts using steam from 18 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at  and intended to reach a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 22 May 1916 the ship only reached a top speed of  from . She had a range of  at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 909 officers and enlisted men in 1916.

The ''Revenge'' class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL)  Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure designated 'A' 'B' 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL  Mk XII guns were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF)  20 cwt Mk I guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes two on each broadside.

''Royal Oak'' was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with  rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower protected by an armoured hood and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by 'X' turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in March 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure.

The ship's waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was  thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ship's ends but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between 'A' and 'X' barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to 'A' and 'Y' barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by  of KC armour except for the turret roofs which were  thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from  above the upper deck but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The ''Revenge''-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from  in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918 from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1934 the platforms were removed from the turrets and a catapult was installed on the roof of 'X' turret along with a crane to recover a seaplane.

=== Major alterations ===
''Royal Oak'' at anchor after her 1924 refit
''Royal Oak'' was extensively refitted between 1922 and 1924 when her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by replacing the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of QF  Mk V AA guns. A  rangefinder was fitted in 'B' turret and a simple high-angle rangefinder was added above the bridge. Underwater protection improved by the addition of anti-torpedo bulges. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability at the cost of widening the ship's beam by over 13 feet (4 m). They increased her beam to  reduced her draught to  increased her metacentric height to  at deep load and all of the changes to her equipment increased her crew to a total of 1188. Despite the bulges she was able to reach a speed of . A brief refit in early 1927 saw the addition of two more four-inch AA guns and the removal of the six-inch guns from the shelter deck. About 1931 a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director replaced the high-angle rangefinder on the spotting top. Two years later the aft pair of torpedo tubes were removed.

The ship received a final refit between 1934 and 1936 when her deck armour was increased to 5 inches (12.7 cm) over the magazines and to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) over the engine rooms. In addition to a general modernisation of the ship's systems her anti-aircraft defences were strengthened by replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun and adding a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder Mk VIII ""pom-pom"" guns to sponsons abreast the funnel. Two positions for ""pom-pom"" anti-aircraft directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the fire-control director in the spotting top. A HACS Mk III director replaced the Mk I in the spotting top and another replaced the torpedo director aft. A pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers .50 machine guns were added abreast the conning tower. The mainmast was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of a radio-direction finding office and a second High-Angle Control Station. The forward pair of submerged torpedo tubes were removed and four experimental 21-inch torpedo tubes were added above water forward of 'A' turret.

Cocoon
Silk moths lay eggs on specially prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings the caterpillars are 10000 times heavier than when hatched and are ready to begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over the tray of caterpillars and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin a water-soluble protective gum and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them leaving some to metamorphose into moths to breed the next generation of caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of silk.

In the year 1868 the Bombay Presidency assigned ''Narayan Jagannath Vaidya'' to replace the Abjad used in Sindhi with the ''Khudabadi script''. The script was decreed a standard script by the Bombay Presidency thus inciting anarchy in the Muslim majority region. A powerful unrest followed after which Twelve Martial Laws were imposed by the British authorities.

According to Islamic Sindhi tradition the first translation of the Quran into Sindhi was completed in the year 883 CE / 270 AH in Mansura Sindh. The first extensive Sindhi translation was done by Akhund Azaz Allah Muttalawi (1747–1824 CE / 1160–1240 AH) and first published in Gujarat in 1870. The first to appear in print was by Muhammad Siddiq (Lahore 1867).

As the legend of the seven years voyage spread crowds of pilgrims and students flocked to Ardfert. Religious houses were formed at Gallerus Kilmalchedor Brandon Hill and the Blasket Islands to meet the wants of those who came for spiritual guidance from Saint Brendan. Saint Brendan is the Patron Saint of sailors and travellers. At the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland a large stained glass window commemorates Brendan's achievements. At Fenit Harbour Tralee a substantial bronze sculpture by Tighe O'Donoghue/Ross was erected to honour the memory of Brendan.  The project including a Heritage Park and the Slí Bhreanainn (the Brendan way) was headed by Fr. Gearóid Ó Donnchadha and completed through the work of the St. Brendan Committee.

Niš Constantine the Great Airport.
Niš Bus Station in the evening.
Niš is strategically located between the Morava river valley in North and the Vardar river valley in the south on the main route between Greece and Central Europe. In the Niš area this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the Nišava river valley which runs towards East in the direction of Sofia and Istanbul.

Historically because of its location the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the Roman Empire that built the important road Via Militaris linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays the city is connected by the highway E75 with Belgrade and Central Europe in north and Skopje Thessaloniki and Athens in the south. The road E80 connects Niš with Sofia Istanbul towards the Middle East and Pristina Montenegro and the Adriatic Sea to the West. The road E771 connects the city with Zaječar Kladovo and Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania.

The city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul. The Niš Constantine the Great airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield was built in 1910. The city public transportation consists nowadays by 13 bus lines. A tram system existed in Niš between 1930 and 1958. Niš Bus Station is the city's largest and main bus station which offers both local urban and intercity transport to international destinations. The largest intercity bus carrier based in the city is Niš-Ekspres which operates to various cities and villages in Serbia Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

120105,Council of Economic Advisers,History 1946-1978,"The Truman administration established the Council of Economic Advisers via the Employment Act of 1946 to provide presidents with objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. 
It was a step from an ""ad hoc style of economic policy making to a more institutionalized and focused process"".
In 1949 Chairman Edwin Nourse and member Leon Keyserling argued about whether the advice should be private or public and about the role of government in economic stabilization. 

Nourse believed a choice had to be made between ""guns or butter"" but Keyserling argued for deficit spending an expanding economy could afford large defense expenditures without sacrificing an increased standard of living. In 1949 Keyserling gained support from Truman advisors Dean Acheson and Clark Clifford. Nourse resigned as chairman warning about the dangers of budget deficits and increased funding of ""wasteful"" defense costs. Keyserling succeeded to the chairmanship and influenced Truman's Fair Deal proposals and the economic sections of National Security Council Resolution 68 that in April 1950 asserted that the larger armed forces America needed would not affect living standards or risk the ""transformation of the free character of our economy.""

During the 1953–54 recession the CEA headed by Arthur Burns deployed non-traditional neo-keynesian interventions which provided results later called the ""steady fifties"" wherein many families stayed in the economic ""middleclass"" with just one family wage-earner. The Eisenhower Administration supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a possible bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession—accelerating public works programs easing credit and reducing taxes—were Arthur F. Burns and Neil H. Jacoby.

Until 1963 -during its first seven years- the CEA made five technical advances in policy making including the replacement of a ""cyclical model"" of the economy by a ""growth model"" the setting of quantitative targets for the economy use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation and replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of a low aggregate demand.

The 1978 Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act required each administration to move toward full employment and reasonable price stability within a specific time period. It has made CEA's annual economic report highly political in nature as well as highly unreliable and inaccurate over the standard two or five year projection periods.

670276,The Silver Lining (video game),Plot,"The game begins approximately one year after the events of ''The Mask of Eternity'' with Rosella and Edgar's wedding on the Isle of the Crown in the land of the Green Isles where Alexander and Cassima are rulers. As Rosella is about to take her vow of marriage a strange man in a black cloak comes from the crowd and casts a spell on her which renders Rosella unconscious. As Edgar catches her Alexander her brother suffers the same fate elsewhere in the castle. The stranger then vanishes from the wedding leaving only his cloak behind.

Having picked up the cloak Graham decides to ask around the castle in order to find out more clues about who its owner might be. Captain Saladin suggests to Graham to visit the Oracle who lives on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain in order to find out more. As Graham dresses up for an adventure and quits the castle a storm begins and he is forced to take refuge in the ferryman's house befriending Hassan. Eventually Hassan agrees to help Graham visit the Isle of the Sacred Mountain and lend his ferry to him. After some conversation with the Winged Ones Graham is escorted to see the Oracle but as she is unable to trace the source of magic from the cloak (knowing only that it is black magic) she sends Graham to see the druids living on the Isle of the Mists. Graham journeys there immediately and talks to the Arch Druid. The latter informs Graham that he is aware of unusual events taking place and while working on a reverse spell from black magic proposes Graham tries to reach his wife and children in their dreams. At the same time Graham is given a list of ingredients that must be found throughout every consequent episode in order to help the Arch Druid counter black magic. As Graham prepares to leave the Isle the storm becomes unusually violent leaving him no other choice but to stay for the night.

Next morning Graham sees the face of Shamir the Court's genie in the scroll and rushes back to the Isle of the Crown. There he visits the library and meets with Ali the book keeper as well as Jollo the royal jester. Ali tells Graham that he knows where to find one of the ingredients but will require a map of the Isles in order to pin its location. As Jollo plays a trick on Graham he is eventually able to gather one of the ingredients for the scroll (the ''lethal liquid''). At the village square Graham manages to get a map copy done for him which he then shows to Ali to obtain the location of the item. Upon visiting Shamir at the Castle Graham finds out that the genie once belonged to one of the members of the so-called ""Black Cloak Society"" who might be the owner of the cloak. Knowing that Valanice (and thus his own children) are descendants of the ""Silver Cloaks"" who were an ancient clan of magic protectors Graham wonders if both are related. He then thanks Shamir and makes his way by sea to the location of the map given by Ali in order to retrieve the second ingredient (a ''magical bag''). Hassan suggests that the third ingredient might be found on the Isle of Wonders but dares not step there after his quarrel with the Red Chess Queen. Graham journeys into the Isle alone and eventually makes his way to obtain the third ingredient (the ''animated vessel''). At the same time a nameless cloaked man shows up in front of Graham and tells him to question Valanice about her druidic roots. As the man disappears Graham runs back into the Castle in order to do so.

At the Castle Valanice falls unconscious as Graham breaks into her room. She sees herself at 23 years of age when she was forcedly taken away from her family by a certain wizard Shadrack. Shadrack keeps her in a deadly tower surrounded by her own nightmares. Back in the Castle Graham by her side keeps a promise to help her. The list shows four new ingredients and Graham continues his adventure. Talking with Shamir the second time reveals to Graham that at least two of the ingredients which he can use to revive the children are found at the Isle of the Mists. Eventually Graham arrives there and meets again with the Arch Druid who confirms the presence of the elements which can only be found in the depths of Mother Nature. In order to address it properly Graham undergoes a ritual in which he proves that he is both a savior and a part of the Nature. Graham passes the guardians and accesses the Sanctuary within the Isle usually only available to druids. There he meets and talks to the spirits of Nature which explain that in order to obtain the requested items (a ''male subject's strength'' and a ''female subject's voice'') Graham must enchant regular items with which he plans to do so. Graham touches the stones on an ancient tree to grant himself such power. Valanice is then shown to him by the spirits and he understands that she was once a druid. At the same time in her dream Shadrack visits her in the tower and begins torturing her. Seeing all this Graham rushes back into the Castle and reaches Valanice's crown transporting himself inside her dream. After some fierce confrontation with the nightmares he steps in and frees Valanice from the tower. As they are back in reality a cutscene reveals that Shadrack was in fact the master of the Black Cloak Society to which another prominent figure Mannanan once belonged. As Mannanan delivers young Valanice to Shadrack Shadrack on the other hand plans on tormenting Valanice In the present Graham vows to destroy Shadrack whatever it takes. Having brought Valanice back into reality he journeys to the Isle of the Mists once more and now asks for the items to be enchanted. Upon returning he gets both ingredients from his children. He gets the third ingredient (a ''silver moon'') from a crescent emerald shape he obtained from the druid tree with the help of a blacksmith and the fourth one (a ''pinch of lively shaken salt'') from the druids at the Isle of the Mists. There he sees Cassima in the scroll and travels back into the Castle to witness her give a speech of hope to her people.

Captain Saladin interrupts Graham's witnessing of the speech by telling him that Rosella is not well in her bed. At the same time a dream sequence shows her venturing into a cave in which stands the Pandora's Box. Shadrack then shows up and orders her to open in. In the present Graham sits next to her then sees his list trace three more ingredients. Outside the castle Graham starts seeing strange things occur in the Green Isles: a bird with eggs which he saw hatch before water flowing backwards in the fountains trees which were torn by the recent storm still undamaged. Graham decides to talk to the Arch Druid about these events but voyaging back to the Isle of the Mists he finds out that the Arch Druid is rather clueless. However upon exiting his hut Grahams meets once again with the nameless cloaked stranger who now reveals that the secret of the events can be found in the gems of the spirit tree which stores the memories of the world. He also notes that one of the ingredients is located with the Winged Ones on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain while the other one can be found at the mansion on the Isle of the Beast. As soon as Graham finds these two the man hints he would know where to find the third one and disappears again. Graham visits the tree as told and the memory stored in its gem reveals to him that Pandora's Box possesses a specific ability of being able to undo any deeds good or bad done by the powerful wizards protectors of magic by the hand of those who dare to open it. Graham understands that Shadrack must have found the Box and tries to open it hence the unexplainable events. Seeing as meeting with the Winged Ones who consider themselves superior to humans has been forbidden to Graham after he visited to Oracle unless he ""learns to fly like them"" Graham continues his journey to the Isle of Beast first where is meets with the Prince Cocteau formerly a hideous beast turned back human with the help of his beloved bride as well as does the necessary in order to obtain another item for the list (this time an ''ebony rose''). Back at the Isle of the Crown Graham meets one of sirens he got a magical bag from and convinces her to give him flying shoes in exchange for a chance for her to fly that he cleverly provides to her with the help of some locals. Having obtained the shoes Graham ventures to the Sacred Mountain right by flight much to the disdain of its rulers where is henceforth granted access. By provoking the four Wind Gods to exercise their power onto a sacred spot in the Mountain Graham eventually obtains the second ingredient (the ''richest fruit'') from a golden tree located there. The list then hints Graham visits the Isle of Wonders where a chess tournament is being currently held. Upon arriving there he is captured hostage by the guards and brought to the Queens who have an argument over the fact that the White Chess King has fled the chessboard. Graham proposes his help and is offered the third ingredient if he succeeds. All Graham then needs is to replace the king with a similar figure crafted by the best masters in the Land which he does and finally obtains the third item (the ''evening glory''). With the three more ingredients crossed out Shamir appears once more in it and Graham rushes into the Castle. Shamir then suggests that Graham visits the Arch Druid in order to bring all the obtained ingredients to use and have a possibility at stopping Shadrack. Back at the Isle of the Mists the Arch Druid accepts the items and demands that Graham reunites with his spouse and children for the time being. Graham does so and promises that come the next day they will all travel to Daventry in order to put an end to Shadrack's plans. That night Valanice once again witnesses a nightmare in which she helps Shadrack finally open the Box as he tortures Rosella. The final sequence of the dream shows the Silver Cloaks being defeated by the Black Cloaks in the past and Valanice gets saved by the nameless stranger. The next day Graham and the family prepare to travel back to Daventry along with Hassan and Edgar but are caught in the unusual storm. Shadrack's projection appears and attacks Graham who is saved at the last minute by the nameless stranger. The cloaked man grants Graham ability to enter dream world by his own will and hence control its time. Now facing the projection once more Graham sacrifices his reality to chase it off and finally stops Shadrack from hurting his family.

The royal family successfully arrives to Daventry but Graham is unconscious. The final episode would feature his wife and children as characters instead of Graham. They must find the Silver Cloak master.

173196,Long Eaton,County issues,"Long Eaton is in the County of Derbyshire on the border with Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire.  Most residences have a Nottingham address with the Nottingham postcode prefix NG and use the Nottingham telephone area code 0115.

It is a common misconception that Long Eaton is part of Nottinghamshire.  The reason for the NG prefix in the postal code is that all mail for Long Eaton first goes to Royal Mail's Nottingham sorting office in Beeston (hence the 'NG') and then to Long Eaton's delivery office on Tamworth Road. Derbyshire can be used in place of the Posttown Nottingham in postal addresses for Long Eaton. Royal Mail does not use the county of Notts or Nottinghamshire.

The Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967) recommended that Long Eaton become part of an enlarged Nottingham City Council.  This was not the only time Long Eaton's status in Derbyshire was threatened as the original draft of the Local Government Act 1972 had considered moving Long Eaton into Nottinghamshire.  The  Redcliffe-Maud Report proposals of 1969 also recommended the town be moved into Nottinghamshire but the incoming Conservative administration rejected the proposal. This issue has rumbled on over many years.

304317,Miniature figure (gaming),Materials,"Traditionally miniatures were cast in white metal an alloy of lead and tin. A small amount of antimony was sometimes added to improve the alloy's ability to take fine detail. In 1993 the New York legislature introduced a bill outlawing lead in miniatures citing public health concerns. Many miniature manufacturers anticipating that other states would also impose bans began making figures with lead-free alloys often at increased price. After months of debate and protests by miniature manufacturers and enthusiasts New York Governor Mario Cuomo signed a bill which exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law. Despite this most American manufacturers continued to use non-lead alloys.

In addition to metal miniatures manufacturers offer figures in plastic (polyethylene or hard polystyrene) and resin . Some wargames use ''box miniatures'' consisting of card stock folded into simple cuboids with representative art printed on the outside.

* The High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth appears in the 1999 animated television series ''Spider-Man Unlimited''. This version is a planet that exists at the other side of the sun. 50 years before the event of the series a man from Earth arrived because he was angry with the human race for causing wars on Earth. The man married with a woman from the planet and raised a family but one day he noticed that the behavior that he left behind started showing up on Counter-Earth. To keep this planet a paradise he started to experiment on animals in an attempt to create a peaceful race. Once he succeeded he named the race ""Beastials."" The Beastials eventually decided to take over the planet and to control the human citizens of Counter-Earth. About thirty years later the man built Castle Wundagore and gave himself the name ""the High Evolutionary"". During the High Evolutionary's reign the Beastials are shown as the dominant species and the humans are a lower-class minority. The High Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore oversaw the Machine Men (a group of robots who serve as the High Evolutionary's police force). Twenty years after the High Evolutionary's arrival John Jameson decided to investigate the planet after NASA's Alita 1 was destroyed by the High Evolutionary in an effort to keep his planet unknown to the people of Earth. Venom and Carnage had their own plans to make Counter-Earth a planet for the Symbiotes. In order to save John Jameson Spider-Man went to Counter-Earth where he had an encounter with the Knights of Wundagore and had befriended the human rebels that John Jameson is helping out. Counter-Earth also includes its own versions of Spider-Man's enemies like Green Goblin (a human rights activist and ally of Spider-Man) the Hunter (Counter-Earth's version of Kraven the Hunter and one of a few humans to live in the upper parts) Vulture (a human who gained Beastial powers) and Electro (who was a Beastial electric eel).

During the early 1950s Archie became affiliated with a variety of right wing organizations and causes. He joined the John Birch Society and was the founder of the controversial Veritas Foundation dedicated to the routing out of presumed socialist influence at Harvard and other major colleges and universities. Writing in the book ''America's Political Dynasties'' (Doubleday 1966) Stephen Hess commented: ""Archie Roosevelt has in recent years added the family's name to many ultra-rightist causes. As a trustee of the Veritas Foundation he was a leader among those seeking to root out subversion at Harvard. He also sent a letter to every U.S. Senator stating 'modern technical civilization does not seem to be as well handled by the black man as by the white man in the United States.' Present civil rights difficulties he blamed on 'socialist plotters.'"" Roosevelt also edited 1968's incendiary ''Theodore Roosevelt On Race Riots Reds Crime.'' and was the chief sponsor behind ""The Alliance"" a short-lived organization of the 1950s.

In 1954 when the Theodore Roosevelt Association made a decision to award the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Distinguished Public Service to black diplomat Ralph Bunche Archie loudly protested the award. He even went so far as to write and publish a 44-page pamphlet that attempted to prove Bunche had been working as an agent of the ""International Communist Conspiracy"" for more than two decades.

In his introduction to Zygmund Dobbs's ''The Great Deceit: Social Pseudo-Sciences'' (Sayville NY: The Veritas Foundation 1964) Archie wrote: ""Socialists have infiltrated our schools our law courts our government our MEDIA OF COMMUNICATIONS. ... the Socialist movement is made up of a relatively small number of people who have developed the TECHNIQUE OF INFLUENCING large masses of people to a VERY HIGH DEGREE.""

133093,Biman Bangladesh Airlines,Fleet,"A Biman Bangladesh Airlines Boeing 737-800 approaches Singapore Changi Airport in 2012.
A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 were the first aircraft in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian joined the airline's fleet allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983 Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990 coming to replace the Fokker F27s.

During the mid-1990s Biman switched its airliner of choice for long haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft. In 1995 two PW4000-powered Airbus A310-300s were ordered; the first of them joined the fleet on . It nevertheless retained its elderly DC–10 fleet. For over three decades the DC–10–30s were Biman's sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well with no noteworthy mechanical problems – in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations. These were operated with Fokker F28 and BAe ATPs which were routinely out of service because of technical trouble. In one incident a government minister disembarked a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft he was on was a BAe ATP. In January 2003 Biman leased two Boeing 737-300s which were used on domestic and regional routes for eighteen months.

McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made up most of Biman's international fleet before the delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors before they were retired in 2012. Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 to come off the production line (l/n 445) and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91 million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977 making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.
A deal was signed in  a three-year contract with a German company for the maintenance of their powerplants for the DC–10s. The airline operates its own ancillary and maintenance facilities at Shahjalal International Airport where it carries out all maintenance work and C-Checks on DC–10–30s and A310–300s.

===Modernisation===

====2000s====
In 2000 Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1 billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In  Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

After Biman became a public limited company renewed attempts were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007 Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as  million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.

On 10 March 2008 the Biman management unveiled a plan to procure eight next-generation wide-bodied aircraft from Boeing Commercial Airplanes for a total cost of  billion including four 419-seater Boeing 777-300ER (average price of  million per unit) and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners that will seat 294 ( million per unit) to be delivered in 2017. The deal for the acquisition of these eight aircraft was signed with Boeing in April 2008 and also included a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of two Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in 2015 with Biman making an initial instalment of  million. Of the remaining cost US-based EXIM bank will finance 85% while a syndication of local banks will finance the balance. In  the same year Biman placed a firm order for two Boeing 737-800s and took options for two more aircraft of the type. The total order for these ten aircraft was valued at around  billion.

====2010s====
A Biman Bangladesh Airlines Airbus A310-300 landing at Shahjalal International Airport in 2012.
In 2010 Biman leased two Boeing 777-200ERs from EuroAtlantic Airways. These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011. To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777-300ERs the airline used an initial  million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase. Wearing a new livery the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER in late October 2011. It was the  777-300ER delivered by Boeing. The  ever delivered Boeing 777-300ER also went to Biman; the airline took possession of it in late . The  Boeing 777-300ER named ''Aakash Pradeep'' was handed over to the carrier in ; the  one named ''Raanga Pravat'' joined the fleet in  following the government approving a  million loan of which  million will be provided by the Ex-Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank.

Biman retired its entire McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet on 20 February 2014 by operating a special Dhaka-Birmingham farewell flight with its last DC-10 with a stopover at Kuwait; the carrier also operated nine separate aviation enthusiasts' scenic flights at Birmingham from 22–24 February three flights a day. The aircraft was then offered for sale as scrap in Dhaka. The Airbus A310-300s were withdrawn from service in October 2016.

The carrier leased two Boeing 777-200ER aircraft from EgyptAir in March 2014. The airline plans to expand its fleet to 16 aircraft to allow route expansion. With newly leased Dash 8-Q400 aircraft the carrier is resuming full swing domestic flights to Cox's Bazar Jessore Saidpur Rajshahi and Barisal in April 2015. The two aircraft dry leased from Smart Aviation Company for a period of five years will also be operated on regional flights to Kolkata and Yangon. Initially it was supposed to resume in November 2013 which Biman failed to as it was unable to find a lessor of aircraft.

In February 2017 it was announced that the airline would acquire three of their own Dash 8-Q400 which will be used to replace the current aircraft leased from Smart Aviation Company to continue operating domestic and regional flights.

===Livery===
A rebranding of Biman in 2010 scrapped after 2 months
In modern Bengali the word বিমান ''biman'' refers to ""aeroplane"" originating from the Sanskrit word ''vimāna'' a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient Vedic literature. The logo painted on the tail is a stylised white stork (বলাকা ''bôlaka'') inside a red circle. The logo was designed by painter Quamrul Hassan. The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section. This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag and has remained so for over two decades.


In 2010 Biman went through a rebranding exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery designed by Teague which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However following change of government Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new more modern revised version of its livery that was applied to the new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.

The ''bôlaka'' has also given its name to the Biman headquarters the ''Balaka Bhaban'' (বলাকা ভবন ''bôlaka bhôban'' Stork Building) and a landmark sculpture in Dhaka depicting storks is in front of Biman's former headquarters the ''Biman Bhaban'' in the Motijheel Commercial Area in Dhaka.

390804,Philip Bobbitt,Views on Constitutional Law,"
Like many contemporary scholars Bobbitt believes that the Constitution's durability rests in part in the flexible manner in which it can be and has been interpreted since its creation. He emphasizes the ""modalities of constitutional argument"": 1) structural; 2) textual; 3) ethical; 4) prudential; 5) historical; and 6) doctrinal. He has argued in his books for the recognition of the ethical modality which has to do with the traditional vision we have of the nation and the role government ought to play (some scholars call this form ""argument from tradition""). He first introduced these forms of argument---or modalities---as a way of understanding constitutional review generally in ""Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution"" (1982) a study of judicial review and then broadened their application to constitutional review generally in Constitutional Interpretation (1993) which deals with non-judicial examples of constitutional argument and decision making. Bobbitt asserts that all branches of government have a duty to assess the constitutionality of their actions.  Constitutional Fate is a commonly used text in courses on constitutional law throughout the U.S.  Bobbitt's ""modalities"" of constitutional law are now generally considered to be the standard model for constitutional arguments.

264585,The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company,History,"
===1859–1878: Gilman era===
The forerunner of A&P was founded in the 1850s as '''Gilman & Company''' by George Gilman (1826–1901) to continue his father's leather tanning business; in 1858 the firm's address was 98 Gold Street in Manhattan. Gilman's father died in 1859 leaving the son wealthy. That year Gilman & Company entered the tea and coffee business from that storefront. One source speculates that Gilman decided to enter a more respectable business in light of his wealth. In May 1861 Gilman turned over the tanning business to his brother Winthrop; George moved his tea business to 129 Front Street. Initially Gilman & Company was a wholesaler. In early 1863 the firm became a retailer '''Great American Tea Company.''' Quickly it opened five stores moving its office and warehouse to 51 Vesey Street.

Gilman proved to be a master at promotion; the business quickly expanded by advertising low prices. The firm was able to offer low prices by acting as both the wholesaler and retailer. Gilman also built a nationwide mail order business. By 1866 the firm was valued at more than $1 million. In 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed; Gilman created a parallel company the '''Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company''' to promote the then-new concept of prepackaged tea under the ''Thea-Nector'' name. The tea company continued to use the ''Great American'' name for mail-order purposes. In 1871 A&P introduced another concept when it offered premiums such as lithographs china and glassware with the purchase of coffee and/or tea at its stores. These premiums are now collectibles.

===1878–1951: Hartford era===

====Evolution of the grocery store====
George Huntington Hartford mid-1870s.

George Huntington Hartford joined Gilman & Company as a clerk perhaps in the late 1850s; Hartford later was promoted to bookkeeper then cashier in 1866. By 1871 Hartford was in a position of authority and was responsible for expanding A&P to Chicago after its great fire. A&P's first store outside New York City was opened just days after the disaster. The firm rapidly expanded; in 1875 A&P had stores in 16 cities. In 1878 Gilman left the active management of the firm to Hartford. By then the firm operated 70 lavishly-equipped stores and a mail order business with combined annual sales of $1 million.

1888 advertisement for A&P from a Norfolk Virginia guidebook listing the range of items carried

To raise revenue Congress significantly raised tariffs on tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A&P started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City and as far south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time two of Hartford's sons George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951) joined the firm. A&P lore is that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include A&P-branded baking powder. Over the next decade the company added other A&P-branded products such as condensed milk spices and butter. As it expanded its offerings the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900 the firm had sales of $5 million from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations. However other grocery chains were expanding more rapidly and blanketing their respective areas while the tea company's stores were spread over a much larger area. A&P quickly found itself at a disadvantage.

Newspaper ad from New York City 1922

In 1901 George Gilman died without a will starting a legal battle among his numerous heirs. The senior Hartford stepped into the battle by asserting that in 1878 Gilman gave him half of the company in an unwritten partnership agreement. Evidence provided to the court established that Hartford received half of A&P's profits starting in 1878 and that the company's leases were in his name. The heirs realized that without Hartford the firm would quickly become unprofitable. Therefore in 1902 they agreed to a settlement where A&P was to be incorporated with $2.1 million in assets. Under this agreement the Gilman heirs received $1250000 in preferred shares at 6% interest while Hartford received $700000 in common stock and the remainder of the preferred shares. This gave Hartford control of the voting stock. Over several years Hartford was able to repurchase the preferred shares from the Gilman heirs.  A&P opened an average of one store every three weeks. A nine-story headquarters and warehouse was built in Jersey City; it later expanded to include a manufacturing plant and bakery.

By 1908 George Hartford Sr. divided management responsibilities among his sons with George Jr. controlling finance with John directing sales and operations. The sons ran A&P for over 40 years. The younger Hartford moved aggressively to promote the ''A&P'' brand dramatically increasing the product line. To make space for the new items A&P replaced in-store premiums with S&H Green Stamps. By 1912 the corporation operated 400 stores and averaged a 22% gross margin resulting in a 2% profit. A&P's peddlers were also operating 5000 rural routes in distinctive red-and-black wagons.

====Development of economy stores====
Food prices were a political issue in the 1912 presidential election after a 35% increase in 10 years. To counter this trend some chains experimented with a no-frills format. After long debate the Hartfords agreed to John's proposal of experimenting with an economy store 
designed to operate at a 12% gross margin. Capitalized at only $3000 including its initial inventory the prototype economy store operated with only a manager and without fancy fixtures. Within two months weekly sales increased to $800 and the store achieved a 30% annual return on investment. A&P quickly expanded the concept; by 1915 the chain operated 1600 stores. A&P's tremendous growth created problems with suppliers. Cream of Wheat was the largest breakfast food manufacturer; it demanded that all retailers adhere to the cereal's pricing per box. A&P purchased the product at wholesale 11 cents per box (3 cents less) and decided that a 1-cent mark-up was appropriate for its economy store format. Cream of Wheat cut off supplies and A&P sued. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Hough ruled against A&P saying that a manufacturer can establish retail prices. As a result A&P and other large chains significantly expanded manufacturing private brands.

Hartford Sr. died in 1917; control of the company passed into a trust with his sons George Edward and John as trustees in complete control.

====Adding stores that included grocery meat produce and dairy====
After World War I A&P rapidly expanded; in 1925 it operated 13961 stores. The newer combination stores included space for meats produce and dairy as well as traditional grocery items. Sales reached $400 million and profit was $10 million. However the Hartford brothers were concerned that gross margins had reached 22% to cover higher costs and that the chain veered from its low-cost discipline. In early 1926 the brothers discussed the situation with division management and launched a program to lower prices and improve cost controls. That year sales increased 32%; A&P moved its headquarters to the new Graybar Building adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. In 1927 A&P established a Canadian division; by 1929 it operated 200 stores in Ontario and Quebec. In 1930 the corporation's 16000 stores reached $2.9 billion in sales resulting in a 25% grocery-store share in its operating areas and about 10% nationwide. No retail company had ever achieved these results. A&P was twice as large as the next largest retailer Sears and four times that of grocer Kroger. Unlike most of its competitors A&P was in excellent position to weather the Great Depression. The Hartfords built their chain without borrowing; their low-price format resulted in even higher sales. From 1929 through 1932 A&P reported a record $110 million in after-tax profits with each Hartford child earning over $5 million yearly in dividends and equity.

A&P's success caused a backlash that threatened to destroy it. Thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores could not match A&P's prices. While small operators had little political clout they were supplied by thousands of wholesale distributors which had considerable political influence. Anti-chain store movements gained traction in the 1920s but became significantly stronger during the Depression. In 1935 Texas Congressman Wright Patman introduced legislation that would have levied a federal tax on chain stores. If adopted this legislation likely would have ended A&P. While this legislation did not move in Congress in 1936 Patman sponsored the Robinson–Patman Act that outlawed charging different prices to similar customers; this law passed. Patman then reintroduced his first bill. A&P retained a lobbyist and dropped its opposition to unionizing activities of the politically powerful American Federation of Labor. George and John Hartford also took the unusual step of publishing an open letter pointing out that the legislation would significantly increase food prices. The tide of public opinion then turned against the bill which was defeated.

====Converting to supermarkets====
Snowdon Quebec 1941
In 1930 the first supermarket opened in California. On the East Coast Michael J. Cullen a then-former A&P employee opened his first King Kullen supermarket in Jamaica Queens. Two years later Big Bear opened in Elizabeth New Jersey and quickly equaled the sales of 100 A&Ps. In 1933 A&P's sales dropped 19% to $820 million because of the competition. After considerable debate the Hartford brothers decided to open 100 supermarkets the first of which was in Braddock Pennsylvania. The new stores proved to be very successful; in 1938 it operated 1100 supermarkets. The chain continued to build supermarkets and slowly phase out its smaller stores except in highly urbanized areas; in 1950 A&P operated 4000 supermarkets and 500 smaller stores. Sales reached $3.2 billion with an after-tax profit of $32 million.

A&P's success attracted the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's anti-trust chief Thurman W. Arnold who was urged to investigate A&P by Congressman Patman. In late 1941 following Pearl Harbor the military placed many large businesses off-limits to the anti-trust division because of defense priorities leaving grocery stores as an option. The next year A&P and its senior executives including the Hartford brothers were criminally charged for restraint of trade in Dallas federal court. However in 1944 prosecutors withdrew the complaint realizing that the Dallas federal judge thought the case was weak. The same day charges were filed in Danville Illinois and were assigned to Federal Judge Walter Lindley. The prosecution complained that A&P had an unfair competitive advantage because its vertical integration including manufacturing warehousing and retailing allowed it to charge lower prices. Prosecutors also complained that A&P refused to buy from food retailers that insisted on selling through brokers or refused to give A&P advertising allowances. The judges contended that if unchecked A&P would become a monopoly. A&P countered that its grocery-store share was only about 15% significantly less than the leaders in other industries. Judge Lindley agreed with the government fining each defendant $10000.

In 1949 the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Lindley's decision; A&P decided not to appeal further. In September the anti-trust division asked the court to order the spin-off of A&P's manufacturing operations and the break-up of A&P's retail operations into seven independent companies. Thousands of letters poured into the Justice Department supporting A&P; the Hartford brothers gave extensive interviews with ''Time'' which put them on the magazine's November 13 1950 cover. ''Time'' wrote that next to General Motors A&P sold more goods than any other retailer in the world. John was quoted as saying ""I don't know any grocer who wants to stay small ... I don't see how any businessman can limit his growth and stay healthy."" The case dragged on into the business-friendly Eisenhower administration. In late 1953 the government agreed to drop its demands to break up A&P if it shut down its produce brokerage that also supplied competitors.

In fighting the anti-trust suits A&P also emphasized the considerable impact of its activities on the public welfare which had been recognized as the legacy of George Hartford Sr. and his sons. The concepts pioneered and perfected by the Hartfords and their competitors enabled the public to enjoy significantly healthier eating at lower cost. In 1950 the average American consumed 10 percent more food than in 1930 with poorer households enjoying an especially important improvement in the quality of the food they consumed. John Kenneth Galbraith supported this contention in his 1952 book ''American Capitalism'' by citing A&P as an example of countervailing power. To support his thesis he discussed a 1937 A&P study of the feasibility of opening a plant to manufacture corn flakes. The mere possibility of A&P producing corn flakes forced existing corn flake manufacturers to lower their prices by 10%.

===1951–1974: Post-Hartford era===
A&P's new stores from 1955 to 1970 tended to be smaller than competitors. This unit in Pluckemin New Jersey remained unchanged (except for A&P's ""sunrise"" logo) until it closed in 2013.

In 1951 John Hartford died in the Chrysler Building after returning from a meeting of the automaker's board of directors. George remained as A&P's chairman and treasurer appointing the corporation's longtime secretary Ralph Burger as its new president. While Burger started with A&P in 1910 as a clerk in Glens Falls New York he was a staffer who lacked John Hartford's strategic marketing skills. Under Burger A&P continued to report record sales and operated with expenses of 12.6% of sales when the industry average was 15%. Burger was also President of the John A. Hartford Foundation started by sons John and George in 1929 assuring Burger's control of A&P when George died in 1957. George's trust was dissolved; the stock began selling on the New York Stock Exchange (under the symbol '''GAP''') at $59 per share. For the first time A&P elected six outside directors onto its board. In late 1961 A&P stock peaked at $70.

The seeds for A&P's 35-year fall from the country's largest grocery to bankruptcy (and later liquidation) were planted in the 1950s:
*'''A&P was starved of capital.''' While A&P was publicly traded control rested with Burger who headed both the corporation and the Hartford trust. Most of A&P's profit was declared as dividends to satisfy the income needs of the trust and its heirs. A&P also remained opposed to debt financing; the only source of capital was the depreciation account. While competitors invested in larger modern supermarkets A&P was slow to update its retail capital plant. By 1970 A&P stores were considerably smaller and mostly older than those of its competitors.
*'''A&P placed too much emphasis on private label products.''' In 1951 the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers could not establish minimum prices unless the retailer agreed to the arrangement. This decision launched a revolution in discount retailing fueled by the rapid increase in television advertising that raised demand for national brands. Contrary to this A&P invested substantial amounts of its scarce capital to expand manufacturing including $25 million to construct the world's largest food plant in Horseheads New York.  Because A&P stores were smaller its shelves were dominated by private-label products and customers found that national brands were often out of stock.
*'''A&P's labor costs were higher than those of most competitors.''' Because A&P stopped growing a rising percentage of its workers were making higher wages due to their seniority. This was not a problem for most of A&P's competitors because they were rapidly expanding and had relatively fewer workers with high seniority. To offset higher labor costs A&P tried to operate stores with fewer employees resulting in long lines at checkouts and empty shelves.

Ralph Burger attempted to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing trading stamps creating A&P's Plaid Stamps. However by late 1962 the initial sales gains evaporated and the six outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963 the stock was trading in the $30s. Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971 the board turned to William J. Kane who joined A&P in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A&P could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations including cleanliness product availability customer service and courtesy. When his program stalled Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A&P to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A&Ps were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973 the stock dropped to $17 and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A&P's continuing difficulties. A&P exited California and Washington State in 1971 and 1974 respectively making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974 the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building moving to Montvale New Jersey.

===1975–2001: Scott/Wood era===
During the Scott/Wood era A&P started to build modern stores. This unit was in Belleville Ontario. Note the ""sunrise"" logo introduced in 1975.
In February 1975 A&P considered a plan by Booz Allen Hamilton to close 36% of its 3468 stores. Kane agreed to resign and was replaced by Jonathan Scott the 44-year-old president of Albertsons. Under Scott A&P closed 1500 stores in three years reducing to 1978 units. Scott hired numerous executives from outside and pushed authority down to the regional level. During his first three years A&P built 300 supermarkets ranging from  to  along with its first combination grocery-drug stores with  under the ''Family Mart'' name. Scott continued Kane's efforts to improve basic store operations (including cleanliness and customer service) instituting a large training program. Weekly per-store sales increased from $37000 in 1974 to over $70000 in 1976 with total sales increasing from $6.4 billion to $7.2 billion despite the closures. Manufacturing was also reorganized. While initial results were promising by 1978 A&P profits started to slide due to economic conditions caused by high inflation.

With the share price down to $7 the John A. Hartford Foundation finally came to the conclusion that it could no longer wait for a turnaround. Erivan Haub owner of the German Tengelmann Group expressed interest. Born in 1930 Haub studied retailing in the U.S. after World War II and built his family's grocery business into a 2000-store chain with annual sales of the equivalent of $2 billion. Although still having a home in Germany his children were born in the United States. Haub agreed to pay $7.375 per share for 42% of A&P's stock. Haub also quietly bought other shares until he owned 50.3% in February 1981. Scott did not renew his five-year contract; Haub hired James Wood to become chairman. Wood an Englishman who was the same age as Haub previously ran the American Grand Union supermarket chain. Many executives recruited by Scott left A&P; they were replaced by Wood's associates from Grand Union. In Germany Tengelmann had considerable success with Plus stores; they were smaller units featuring low price private-label products along with a limited assortment of meats and produce. A&P opened several divisions of Plus stores in the U.S. to take advantage of A&P's manufacturing plants and numerous small stores. However the concept failed to win American customers who were attracted to other chains offering low prices on national brands.

James Wood realized that another massive store-closing program was necessary to turn around A&P. In October 1981 it announced that it would downsize to under 1000 stores and close the Chicago division. Under the plan A&P also closed its large manufacturing group except the four coffee warehouses. To finance this program A&P planned to terminate its non-union pension plan using its $200 million surplus. The plan's obligations were covered by annuities that cost only about $130 million because of the then high interest rates. A&P's non-union employees were covered by a defined contribution 401(k) plan. William Walsh then a recently retired executive filed a class action that was ultimately settled by increasing the value of the annuities. A&P still realized over $200 million and was not required to pay taxes because of tax losses carried forward from previous closing programs. The Philadelphia division also was to close unless the unions agreed to contract concessions. When the unions refused A&P started implementing the plan. The unions offered to purchase the stores but realized that they did not have the capital required. As an alternative the unions agreed to a profit-sharing arrangement if A&P formed a new subsidiary and operated under a different name. The new banner ""Super Fresh"" proved profitable. A&P realized that its name was not the asset it had been.

A&P Fresh Midland Park New Jersey: Built in the late 1990s it became an ACME in 2015 due to A&P's liquidation. A&P started to acquire stores from other chains. In 1982 Stop & Shop exited New Jersey not returning for almost 20 years. A&P purchased most of these stores to replace obsolete ones. In 1983 A&P bought Wisconsin-based Kohl's Food Stores (which had been part of the Kohl's department store chain) from BATUS enabling A&P to reenter Wisconsin and Illinois. In 1984 A&P purchased Pantry Pride's Richmond Virginia division. The next year A&P reinforced its profitable Canadian division by closing stores in Quebec and acquiring Ontario's Dominion Stores. In the U.S. A&P started construction of larger  supermarkets known as ''A&P Future Stores''. In 1986 A&P purchased Waldbaum's (with stores in southern New York and southern New England) and The Food Emporium the latter an upscale New York City-based chain. In 1989 A&P acquired Michigan-based Farmer Jack; also A&P attempted to expand into Europe by bidding unsuccessfully for the Gateway Corporation (then the United Kingdom's third-largest grocery chain). At the end of the decade A&P reported a profit of 1.3% (compared to an industry average of 1.04%) on sales of $11 billion.

In the early 1990s A&P started to struggle again because of the economy and new competition especially Walmart. In 1992 A&P's sales dropped to $1.1 billion; it posted a loss of $189 million. A&P responded by strengthening its private label program and overhauling its remaining U.S. units. Most stores smaller than  were expanded closed or replaced with units from  to . The new stores included pharmacies larger bakeries and more general merchandise. A&P continued to suffer in the South and abandoned most of the region by pulling out of Alabama Florida Georgia Kentucky the Carolinas Tennessee and Virginia; most of these stores were sold to Kroger. As a result A&P was reduced to four regions: the Northeast the Midwest (Michigan and Wisconsin) New Orleans and Ontario. To reinforce the New Orleans division A&P purchased six Schwegmann supermarkets; however A&P was now reduced to 600 stores. Christian W.E. Haub the youngest son of Erivan became co-CEO in 1994 and CEO in 1997 when Wood retired from that post. In 2001 Wood also retired as Chairman with Haub assuming that title as well.

===2001–2015: Final years as a supermarket chain===
A&P modified its sunrise logo in 2005 removing the colored bands and shrinking the oval's size. A modified version of this logo is still used on Best Cellars liquor stores
Upon becoming a private company in 2012 A&P debuted a circular logo. The previous two logos were also used until the supermarkets closed.

Nationwide Walmart gained a dominant position in the grocery industry forcing much of the competition to downsize though in A&P's core Northeast market Walmart was and still is not a major grocery competitor.  In 2003 after declaring its largest loss A&P closed Kohl's Food Stores and A&P's remaining stores in Vermont and New Hampshire reducing it to just over 500 stores. Also in 2003 A&P spun off the Eight O'Clock Coffee division (its last manufacturing operation) to Gryphon Investors for $107 million. (In 2006 Gryphon sold Eight O'Clock Coffee to Tata Global Beverages for $220 million). In 2005 A&P sold its 237-store Canadian division (consisting of A&P Dominion and Food Basics units) to Montreal-based Metro Inc. for C$1.7 billion in cash plus shares of Metro. By 2009 the ''A&P'' name disappeared from these stores. In 2007 A&P closed its New Orleans division limiting A&P's footprint to the Northeast. Also in 2007 A&P acquired Pathmark a long-time Northeastern rival for $1.4 billion. This allowed A&P to regain its position as the largest grocery retailer in the New York City area and the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. However the Federal Trade Commission declared that as a result of the acquisition A&P would be a monopoly in parts of Long Island and Staten Island. As part of its settlement with the FTC the corporation was forced to divest of some Waldbaum's and Pathmarks.

When A&P marked its 150th anniversary in 2009 it was ranked only No. 21 by ''Supermarket News'' of the top 75 North American grocery retailers based on 2008 fiscal year estimated sales of US$9.6 billion. Tengelmann held approximately 38.5 percent of A&P with Yucaipa holding a 27.5 percent share; the rest was held by individual shareholders and investor groups. Christian Haub was Chairman. Eric Claus then President and CEO left A&P with Sam Martin assuming these responsibilities.

All stores were closed by November 25 2015.


The recession hit many supermarkets as customers migrated to discount markets in even greater numbers. A&P was especially hard hit because of its increased debt load to complete the Pathmark purchase. In June 2010 A&P stopped paying $150 million in rent on the closed Farmer Jack stores. In August A&P announced that it would close another 25 stores in Connecticut Maryland New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania: 13 Pathmarks 6 A&Ps 2 Waldbaum's and 4 Super Fresh stores. In September A&P announced it was selling seven Connecticut stores to Big Y. On December 10 2010 bankruptcy rumors surfaced; A&P stock tumbled from over $3 per share to below $1 before trading was halted. Two days later A&P announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains New York A&P listed over $2.5 billion in assets and $3.2 billion in debt.

After the filing A&P remained in operation (with its stock symbol changed to '''GAPTQ''') while it developed a reorganization plan. In November 2011 the corporation announced that it had entered into an agreement to receive $490 million of debt and equity financing from Yucaipa Mount Kellett Capital Management and investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The agreement enabled A&P to complete its restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11 as a private entity in early 2012. At this time Christian Haub left A&P and Tenglemann wrote off its books the remaining equity.

====Second Chapter 11 bankruptcy and supermarket shutdown====
A&P briefly returned to modest profitability by cutting costs in its remaining stores although customer spending further decreased. In 2013 again a company A&P was put up for sale but could not find a suitable buyer. In January 2014 Sam Martin resigned. In March Paul Hertz was named CEO and President as the company broke even. On January 15 2015 the trade publication ''Supermarket News'' reported that A&P was still for sale. There were rumors of several parties being interested including Cerberus still owning Albertsons assets; however no suitable offers were received. In May rumors emerged that A&P was in more financial trouble as it declared a huge loss (in April) for the previous year losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away A&P considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years. There were rumors that A&P would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices shrinking the company to about 100 stores; other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation selling the company in pieces as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored including selling other assets.

On July 19 2015 A&P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection immediately closing 25 underperforming stores. The next day A&P announced that 76 of its stores (including Super Fresh and Pathmark units as well as one Food Emporium unit) had been sold to Albertsons (owner of Philadelphia-based Acme Markets). Stop & Shop purchased 25 units mainly Pathmarks in New York City Nassau and Suffolk counties. The Key Food co-operative acquired 23 units mainly in New York City including all remaining Food Basics and Food Emporium stores. Morton Williams acquired two Food Emporium stores in Manhattan while Wakefern Food Corporation the cooperative which runs ShopRite and PriceRite acquired 12 units including 9 Pathmark stores. Local grocers also acquired units either through sales or auctions. All supermarkets were closed by November 25 (Thanksgiving eve). The last remaining portion of A&P ''Best Cellars at A&P'' had its stores auctioned in summer 2016 with 11 stores sold (none as going concerns) and 6 leases rejected.

574987,Law of comparative judgment,Introduction,"The '''law of comparative judgment''' was conceived by L. L. Thurstone. In modern-day terminology it is more aptly described as a model that is used to obtain measurements from any process of pairwise comparison. Examples of such processes are the comparison of perceived intensity of physical stimuli such as the weights of objects and comparisons of the extremity of an attitude expressed within statements such as statements about capital punishment. The measurements represent how we perceive objects rather than being measurements of actual physical properties. This kind of measurement is the focus of psychometrics and psychophysics.

In somewhat more technical terms the law of comparative judgment is a mathematical representation of a '''discriminal process''' which is any process in which a comparison is made between pairs of a collection of entities with respect to magnitudes of an attribute trait attitude and so on. The theoretical basis for the model is closely related to item response theory and the theory underlying the Rasch model which are used in psychology and education to analyse data from questionnaires and tests.

717216,History of the United States Democratic Party,Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909),"The 1896 election marked a political realignment in which the Republican Party controlled the presidency for 28 of 36 years. The Republicans dominated most of the Northeast and Midwest and half the West. Bryan with a base in the South and Plains states was strong enough to get the nomination in 1900 (losing to William McKinley) and 1908 (losing to William Howard Taft). Theodore Roosevelt dominated the first decade of the century and to the annoyance of Democrats ""stole"" the trust issue by crusading against trusts.

Anti-Bryan conservatives controlled the convention in 1904 but faced a Theodore Roosevelt landslide. Bryan dropped his free silver and anti-imperialism rhetoric and supported mainstream progressive issues such as the income tax anti-trust and direct election of Senators.

417701,King Power Stadium,History,"
===Background and construction===
Leicester's previous stadium was at nearby Filbert Street which had been their home since 1891. It was gradually upgraded during the 20th century and with the advent of the Taylor Report in January 1990 requiring all clubs in the top two divisions to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994 Leicester City's directors began to investigate building a new stadium during the early 1990s but decided to take the redevelopment option by building a new stand on one side of Filbert Street and fitting seats into the remaining standing areas giving the stadium a 21500 all-seated capacity by the 1994–95 season.

Filbert Street's conversion to an all-seater stadium coincided with their promotion to the Premier League after a seven-year exile from the top flight and with their relegation after just one season it appeared the 21500 capacity would be adequate.

However success in the late 1990s saw crowds rise which meant virtually every game at Filbert Street was a sell-out by the end of the decade. Relocation was soon back on the cards; several similar sized clubs had relocated to new stadiums around this time including Leicester's midland rivals Stoke City and Derby County.

Some parts of the ground – the East and North Stands in particular – were also somewhat outdated which led the manager Martin O'Neill to joke that when he showed Filbert Street to new signings he led them backwards out of the players tunnel to prevent them from seeing the East Stand.

In early 1998 plans were announced for a 40000 all-seater stadium to be built at Bede Island South in time for the 2000–01 season but they were abandoned on 5 January 2000. Chairman John Elsom vowed other options including relocation to another site or even further redevelopment of Filbert Street would be considered hoping either option would have materialised by August 2002.

The relocation option was soon settled upon as plans were unveiled on 2 November 2000 for a 32000-seat stadium at nearby Freeman's Wharf with 2003–04 being the expected completion date although it was suggested at the time relocation could happen at the start of the 2002–03 season. Work on the stadium began in the summer of 2001 and by 10 October that year it was confirmed the new stadium would be ready for the 2002–03 season.

The stadium was completed on time in the summer of 2002 ready for Leicester to take up residence for the start of the 2002–03 season. However it was not an easy start at their new stadium as they had just been relegated from the Premier League and were more than £30 million in debt. The stadium is thought to have cost around £37 million to build.

The stadium also has under-soil heating.

The record attendance for football at the stadium is 32242 this was Leicester City's first home game of the 2015–16 season against Sunderland. The overall record attendance at the stadium is thought to be between 32488-32500 for a rugby union match between Leicester Tigers and Bath in 2006. This is because this rugby match took place prior to seats being removed to provide segregation of rival football fans reducing the capacity of the ground from exactly 32500 to 32262.

===Opening===
The stadium was officially opened by former Leicester striker Gary Lineker on 23 July 2002. He used a giant pair of scissors to cut a ribbon on the pitch after arriving at the stadium in a Walkers lorry. The first game at the new stadium was a friendly against Spanish team Athletic Bilbao on 4 August 2002. The game finished 1–1 with Tiko scoring the first goal at the stadium and Jordan Stewart scoring Leicester's first goal. The attendance was approximately 24000 (no official figure was recorded due to a computer problem). The first competitive match took place six days later and Leicester beat Watford 2–0 in front of a near-capacity crowd of 31022. Brian Deane scored both goals including the stadium's first in competitive games. Leicester ended the 2002–03 season promoted back to the Premier League losing just two home games in the season despite spending the early part of the season in receivership due to their huge debts until a takeover deal was completed.

===Ownership===
The £37 million cost of the new stadium combined with relegation from the Premiership the collapse of the English transfer market due to the introduction of the transfer window and the collapse of ITV Digital meant Leicester went into receivership shortly after moving to the new stadium. Birse Construction who had built the stadium therefore lost a large part of their fee and they withdrew from football ground construction. The main losers from this were Leicester's local rivals Coventry City who were in negotiations with Birse to build their own new stadium.

As part of the deal which brought the club out of receivership the stadium's ownership reverted to American academic retirement fund TIAA–CREF who had supplied £28 million via a bond scheme towards the stadium's construction with the club taking a long-term lease while the bond repayments were made.

On 1 March 2013 Leicester City's Thai owners King Power bought the ground through their company K Power Holdings Co Ltd.

===Plans===
In 2015 vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated plans were in place to increase the ground's capacity to around 42000. Relocation to a bigger stadium has also been considered.

Parts of the movie were filmed in and around Balmain with a number of scenes at the Kent Hotel (which later became ''Caddies Restaurant'') and the Sir William Wallace Hotel. Other scenes were filmed in Cameron Street Edgecliff. Studio shots were taken at the Cinesound Studios in Rozelle. The writer and producer had both made films about early Australian cinema and were able to draw on this knowledge to help recreate Depression-era Sydney.

In 1912 three years after Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto Antonio Sant'Elia and Mario Chiattone take part to the ''Nuove Tendenze'' exhibition in Milano.  In 1914 the group presented their first exposition with a ""Message"" by Sant'Elia that later with the contribution of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti became the ''Manifesto dell’Architettura Futurista'' (""Manifesto of Futurist Architecture""). Also Boccioni unofficially worked on a similar manifesto but Marinetti preferred Sant'Elia's paper.

Later in 1920 another manifesto was written by Virgilio Marchi ''Manifesto dell’Architettura Futurista–Dinamica'' (""Manifesto of Dynamic Instinctive Dramatic Futurist Architecture"").  Ottorino Aloisio worked in the style established by Marchi one  example being his Casa del Fascio in Asti.

Another futurist manifesto  related to architecture is the ''Manifesto dell’Arte Sacra Futurista'' (""Manifesto of Sacred Futurist Art"") by Fillia (Luigi Colombo) and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published in 1931. On 27 January 1934 it was the turn of the Manifesto of Aerial Architecture by Marinetti Angiolo Mazzoni and Mino Somenzi. Mazzoni had publicly adhered to futurism only the year before. In this paper the Lingotto factory by Giacomo Matté-Trucco is defined as ''the first Futurist constructive invention''. Mazzoni himself in those years worked on a building considered today a masterpiece of futurist architecture like the Heating plant and Main controls cabin at Santa Maria Novella railway station in Florence.

27804,AltiVec,Comparison to x86-64 SSE,"
Both VMX/AltiVec and SSE feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts four 32-bit ints or four 32-bit floating point variables.  Both provide cache-control instructions intended to minimize cache pollution when working on streams of data.

They also exhibit important differences. Unlike SSE2 VMX/AltiVec supports a special RGB ""pixel"" data type but it does not operate on 64-bit double precision floats and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and vector registers. In keeping with the ""load/store"" model of the PowerPC's RISC design the vector registers like the scalar registers can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of ""horizontal"" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in x86-64) and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on IA-32.

VMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector permute instruction in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors parametrized by yet another vector.  This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.

Recent versions of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) IBM VisualAge compiler and other compilers provide intrinsics to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from C and C++ programs. As of version 4 the GCC also includes auto-vectorization capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The ""vector"" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types e.g. ""vector unsigned char foo;"" declares a 128-bit vector variable named ""foo"" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as ""vec_add"" that emit the appropriate op code based on the type of the elements within the vector and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register whether it contains integers or floating point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use e.g. ""_mm_add_epi16(xy)"" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.

195782,State of Origin,History,"The first recorded call for 'state of origin' selection rules for interstate football was made in 1900. A journalist known as ""The Cynic"" writing for a rugby football periodical called ''The Referee'' suggested that Stephen Spragg who had moved to Queensland should be able to play for his state of birth New South Wales. The change did not eventuate with residential selection rules prevailing both before and after the split into rugby league and rugby union until the concept was later resurrected for league. However in rugby union the concept has never been used as the Queensland and New South Wales teams ceased to be representative instead becoming more like clubs.

The Australia rugby union first came up with the concept and at the same time the Blue and Maroon Jersey was born back in 1899 it was then when the first Rugby Union test match was played. The opponent at the time were actually the touring British Isles team and a three tests series was played - two in Sydney and one in Brisbane. Because there was no national jersey the team wore the jersey of the state in which they were playing but with the Australian Coat of Arms in place of the state emblem or logo.

Therefore for the first and third tests in Sydney the jersey was blue with the coat of arms and for the second test in Brisbane the jersey was maroon. This was also an indication of the makeup of the team which was dominated by New South Wales  for the tests played in Sydney and by Queensland players for the tests played in Brisbane.

=== Rugby league (Australia) ===


Traditionally the basis for selecting players in representative international sides (i.e. their country of origin) did not extend to interstate sides in Australian rugby league. Instead players represented the state in which they played their club football as per the 'residency rule' in which they played for the club which represented the district they lived in. This gave a significant advantage to New South Wales as the movement of players south was far greater than the movement north.

Former Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon who had later become a journalist was the first to suggest that Sydney-based Queenslanders should be available for selection to represent their state. This would not eventuate until decades later however when New South Wales and Queensland played their first ""state of origin"" match on 8 July 1980. The Australian rules experience was echoed with Queenslanders showing enormous interest in the game at Lang Park Brisbane although NSW-based players and journalists described it as ""the non-event of the century"". Queensland defeated New South Wales in that match and State of Origin has grown into Australia's greatest sporting rivalry.

The popularity of State of Origin matches since then has not waned and they remain one of Australia's (and indeed the region's) biggest sporting events. A record crowd of 88336 attended a game at Stadium Australia in 1999. The record for the annual three game series was set in 2004 when a total of 203309 people attended. The 2005 series saw an attendance record for a series with two matches in Queensland with 187374. The record television audience was set during game 1 of the 2009 series and stands at 3.48 million. Queensland has won 18 series from 1982–2013 and NSW has won 13 with 2 drawn. Queensland have won the most series in a row. (8 Series  2006-2013).

Australian international teams are often selected based on performance in the State of Origin series.

New South Wales play in sky blue jerseys and are known as ""the Blues"" a term dating from 1974 when a journalist used the name in an article. The Blues won that series leading coach Jack Gibson to comment ""I thought they went pretty well for a bunch of cockroaches"". The Queensland team plays in a maroon jersey and are called ""the Maroons"". Both teams also have unbecoming nicknames - New South Wales: ""the Cockroaches""; Queensland: ""the Cane Toads"".

===Australian Football===

The first 'state of origin' game was an Australian Football game between  Western Australia (WA) and Victoria at Subiaco Oval in Perth on 8 October 1977. Leon Larkin marketing manager of the Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) negotiated with the VFL for two years before arrangements for the game were finalised. In the words of football historian John Devaney:



Games involving each of the other states soon followed. In 1989 a crowd of 91960 people — a record for interstate games in Australian rules — attended a game between Victoria and South Australia at the MCG.

However attendance and interest declined during the 1990s due to a variety of factors such as the VFL's ongoing conversion into a national club competition the Australian Football League (AFL). The last official state of origin game involving AFL players was held in 1999. However an annual veterans' game is still held.

A once-off AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match between a Victorian state of origin side and the ''Dream Team'' representing the other states was staged on 10 May 2008 to celebrate 150 years of Australian Football.

===Rugby league (England)===


The success of the State of Origin series in Australian rugby league resulted in the revival of England's inter-county games in 2001 under the name Origin Series. However the revival was scrapped in 2003 amid increasing fixture congestion and general apathy from league supporters.

The International Origin Match held from 2011 to 2013 was more of an all-star game as it pitted the England national team against Australian and New Zealand stars in the largely English-based Super League.

===Other State of Origin events===

Due to the success of the larger State of Origin events many sporting clubs and or association have started their own annual State of Origin series across Australia and New Zealand. Rivalry is high in sports and its proven to be a great concept. Predominantly the sporting organization or associations adopt their Team Colours as uniforms its team building and holds significant passion for there event.

In Australia sprint car racing often uses a State of Origin format in registering car numbers.  Each driver's car number is preceded in official results sheets by their home state.  Foreign drivers are also designated in the State of Origin format.  In some instances a team's state of origin will be used instead of a driver.

A1 - Current national sprint car champion. 
ACT - Australian Capital Territory (Canberra et al.) 
NSW (or N) - New South Wales 
NQ – North Queensland 
NT – Northern Territory 
Q (or QLD) – Queensland 
S (or SA) – South Australia
T – Tasmania
V – Victoria
W – Western Australia

Foreign drivers are also given a State of Origin code:

NZ - New Zealand 
US – United States

In addition during the 2016-17 season Valvoline Raceway in Clyde NSW on January 12 will institute the inaugural State of Origin for sprint car racing.  The State of Origin contest will also feature a ""guest"" foreign team of drivers as it is held in January.  http://valvolineraceway.com.au/release.asp?NewsId=53967

369399,Gag (BDSM),Safety,"Gagging anybody is very risky as it involves a substantial risk of asphyxia if the subject's nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never be left alone.

In practice no gag is effective enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud inarticulate noises to call for help. Thus a pattern of noises such as three grunts in rapid succession is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal safety mechanism such as a solid object held in the hand that can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.

The name comes from the Latin ''organum'' meaning any tool in general or any musical instrument in particular (or an organ of the body) which in turn came from the Greek ''organon'' with similar meanings itself derived from ''ergon'' and so meaning something by which a task is accomplished. The name ''organum'' in turn gave rise to the modern everyday term ''organ''.

108842,San Pedro Sula,History,"The city grew slowly from about 800 residents in 1590 to almost 10000 by the 1890s but most of this population growth took place in the 19th century. It benefited initially from the growth of bananas for export in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US based shipper and railroad entrepreneur Samuel Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at Puerto Cortés. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish itself and along the way to pay very few taxes.

TD Place Arena interior.
'''TD Place Arena'''
The Ottawa 67's have played at TD Place Arena since January 1968 when it was known as the Ottawa Civic Centre. The Arena has the largest capacity of all current OHL arenas.

:''Capacity'' = 9862
:''Ice Size'' = 200' x 85'

Ottawa TD Place Arena exterior.
The design of TD Place Arena is unique in that it is built into the side of a football stadium and includes a large conference hall under its north stands. The seating in TD Place Arena is almost all on the north side and ends of the arena with very few seats on the south side towards the football stadium.

TD Place Arena has played host to many OHL and CHL events including:
:The Memorial Cup in 1972 and 1999.
:The Chrysler Challenge Cup in 1986 and 1987.
:The Hershey Cup in 2002.

The Centre has also been the brief home to the NHL's Ottawa Senators and the WHA's Ottawa Nationals & Ottawa Civics.

'''Canadian Tire Centre'''
The Ottawa 67's also play the occasional home game at the Canadian Tire Centre. Twice the 67's played host to an interleague game versus the Gatineau Olympiques of the QMJHL. On December 30 2004 the arena hosted the largest crowd ever witnessed in the Ontario Hockey League as 20081 people saw the Ottawa 67's defeated by the Kingston Frontenacs. This came as a result of the arena seating capacity being expanded by 2000 seats.

In early February 2012 it was announced that the 67's would move to the Canadian Tire Centre for two seasons while renovations were finished at TD Place Arena. This came as a result of delays in construction originally planned to allow the 67's to stay at TD Place through the rebuild but now a closed site is needed to meet deadlines for NASL and CFL expansion.

221313,Roxanne (film),Plot,"C.D. ""Charlie"" Bales the fire chief of the small ski town of Nelson British Columbia is intelligent humorous charismatic athletic and skilled. Bales is sensitive about his large nose which many in town have learned to not mention. He is unable to have it surgically altered because of a dangerous allergy to anesthetics. He is close to many in town especially his godsister Dixie who owns the town diner and several rental homes. He becomes immediately attracted to beautiful newcomer Roxanne Kowalski an astronomy graduate student renting from Dixie while searching for a new comet during the summer. She adores Bales but only as a friend preferring Chris a handsome but dim fireman.

Roxanne goes to Bales for help when Chris fails to advance their relationship further than curious glances. Through a turn of events she falsely believes Chris is deeply intelligent. When Bales informs Chris of Roxanne's interest Chris gets sick intimidated by intelligent women. Chris starts to write her a letter but takes all day with little result. He convinces Bales to write the letter with prose that soon woo Roxanne. When informed that Roxanne wants to meet him Chris again gets sick and refuses to meet until Bales comes up with a plan to allow him to be as brilliant as his letter makes him appear. Chris arrives at Roxanne's house with a hunter's cap on hiding the earphones that relay Bales' words. When the equipment fails Chris bungles the meeting by speaking his own crass thoughts. After Roxanne storms back into the house furious Chris begs Bales to fix his mess again. At first he repeats what he is told from under a tree beneath Roxanne's window but soon also ruins that. Then they switch jackets and hats so Bales can speak the words as Chris. They achieve their goal and she invites Chris in to make love.

Roxanne gets word about the comet and has to go out of town for a week. Since she cannot find Chris she gives Bales the address of her hotel and asks him to tell Chris to write to her. Bales writes her several times a day each letter more incredible than the last. They affect Roxanne so deeply that she returns early. Bales is writing a new letter to her in Dixie's diner when he finds out that Chris (who knows nothing about the letters) is on his way to see Roxanne. He arrives at her home and warns Chris that Roxanne would be mentioning some letters that he supposedly wrote. She tries to get Chris to be the man in the letters revealing that his looks are only secondary to her. Knowing that his looks are all he has Chris runs out leaving her confused. Dixie puts the last letter under her door and after reading it Roxanne calls Bales over.

Chris prepares to leave town with a bartender Sandy whom he met while Roxanne was away. When she asks if he has told Roxanne (the women are acquaintances) he replies that he will write her a letter since he has a history of it.

Bales arrives unaware that Roxanne knows the truth. She asks him to read one of the letters and then to look at the back which shows that Dixie revealed its true author. She explodes in anger that he lied to her. He retorts that he simply wanted to tell her how he felt about her but she was only interested in Chris's attractiveness. When he reminds her that it only took a few nice words for Chris to get her into bed she punches him in the face and throws him out. As he prepares to say more he stops and sniffs the air. He slowly walks back to the firehouse and alerts his team who then ""follow his nose"" until they find and extinguish the fire. During their celebration afterwards someone mentions his nose and although everyone thinks he will get upset he doesn't.

Back home sitting on his roof Bales hears someone speaking his words to him. It's Roxanne declaring that she realizes now that it was everything from Bales that she loved not Chris' looks. Bales descends from the roof and they reconcile. During the credits she reveals that she named the comet ""Charlie""—after her father.

On 20 August Fearon persuaded Darren Bark (then 33 years old) also from Newark-on-Trent to drive Fred Barras and himself to the farm. Bark stayed in the car waiting in a lane while Fearon and Barras entered the farmhouse. When confronted they attempted to flee through a window but were shot by Martin; Fearon in the leg and Barras in the back. Barras died at the site but Fearon managed to escape and obtain medical assistance from a couple in a cottage nearby. Martin subsequently left the farm and spent the night at a friend's house. 

On 10 January 2000 Fearon and Bark admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin's farmhouse.  Fearon was sentenced to three years in prison and Bark to 30 months (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences).  Fearon was released on 10 August 2001.

In April of the same year Martin was convicted of murdering Barras the charge was reduced to manslaughter the sentence to 5 years on appeal due to diminished responsibility. Fearon was released after eighteen months Martin after about three years having been refused early parole.

It is written entirely in the Latin alphabet albeit with various diacritics suitable for expressing Ladino phonetics. This distinguishes this translation from others from the same century printed in Constantinople entirely in Hebrew script.  Both were based on the previous Spanish oral tradition.

The tetragrammaton is translated as ''A.'' (for Adonai).

It was a basis for the 1569 translation of Casiodoro de Reina as shown in the ""Amonestacion al Lector"" found before the biblical text written by the translator himself wherein he writes the following:

616944,Sufra,History,"Mamdani founder of Sufra''

=== Initial Idea and Start up: 2011-2013 ===
In 2011 Sufra was proposed by Mohammed Mamdani a social entrepreneur who founded Muslim Youth Helpline; Ansar laumched Project and Al-Mizan Charitable Trust which was  in 2012 until eventually it was officially founded in April 2013. Sufra is an Arabic term meaning ""Come to the table"". The aim of the charity was to provide local people with food and even basic necessities and toiletries.

Sufra moved into new premises at Carlton Kitchen in Kilburn in September 2013 on a 3-month lease. Operationally food collections had been successful with regular donations from key supermarkets and schools. Since start of operations Sufra has distributed food parcels to over 300 people in need. These clients have come through local referral agencies. in April 2013 by the local London Borough of Brent to relocate in St Raphael's Estate as this was one of the poorest estate in the local area.

=== Food Academies Business Enterprise Project and Welfare Surgeries: 2014-2015 ===
In June 2014 Sufra began to run Food Academies alongside being a charity it also became a local community centre aiming to bring the community together by running food academies and teaching people to cook. The main aim was to train young people between the ages of 16–25 years in basic cookery skills. Over 5 weeks and 10 intensive sessions it hopes to teach people to cook 10 home-cooked meals understand nutrition and how to maintain a healthy diet. In addition to this they run a master-chef competition and learn to manage weekly budgets with an accredited qualification which can be used to apply for an apprenticeship or employment in the catering industry.
''Sufra after its 2015 renovation''

In January 2015 Sufra joined a partnership with Aston Business School. It launched a recruitment drive for their first Business Enterprise Project which was sponsored by Segro. The project was aimed between 16 and 25 years who've got a business idea and help them get it off the ground. The Business Enterprise Project includes a free 5-day residential at Aston University’s Business School where candidates will learn everything they need to know about setting up their business followed by personal mentoring a grant of £500 and free office space.

During this time Sufra also began to provide Welfare Surgeries for existing users. Users who already have a food bank voucher or are taking part in any other programme or activity are able to request additional support from the lead staff member or volunteers. The Food Bank states that they do not support every case and that only a limited number of cases are taken on a weekly basis. Generally they began providing the following; assistance with CVs and job applications assistance with online benefit forms guidance on issues relating to benefits housing or employment and even arranging for specialist help and support.

=== Food Academy Plus and St. Raphael's Edible Garden: 2016-2017 ===

Sufra expanded their kitchen in the beginnings of 2016 allowing them to provide a hot-meals service to individuals and families every Friday between 6:30pm and 9:00pm.  The service is open to all members of the community and they encourage members of the public to join them and eat alongside the most disadvantaged in the community providing informal peer-support and a listening service.
During the summer of 2016 Sufra decided to launch a more sophisticated approach with Food Academy and launched Food Academy Plus. This programme aimed to recruit train and find employment for 20 adults in the catering industry. Across the programme participants learn professional cooking skills project management skills and customer service. There is also compulsory study sessions in numeracy literacy and ICT work experience in a professional restaurant at the London Designer Outlet – as well as the support of a mentor and employment coach throughout. The programme includes setting up a pop-up restaurant at Sufra NW London where the charity invites local employers to see the skills of our graduates first-hand and head-hunt for new chefs waiters and restaurant staff. As an incentive participants receive a free chef’s uniform 3-month bus pass and access to all in-house support and opportunities available at Sufra NW London. That includes a discretionary fund which is used to financially support vulnerable and/or low-income volunteers.

In November 2016 Sufra was also featured on episode 1 of BBC's ''The Big Food Rescue''. Which followed two men on a mission to change Britain's food habits by rescuing the fresh food that supermarkets used to bin and getting it to the people who need it.

In 2016 Brent Council approved a growing garden project. The garden project was located just a minute walk away from Sufra's main office and was named St. Raphael’s Edible Garden. This was a new food growing project on St. Raphael’s Estate which aims to confront the causes and effects of poverty in the local community. The charity officially laumched the project in March 2017 and runs a Growing Club twice a week on Wednesdays and Sundays from 10am to 2pm.

On 1 June 2017 Sufra launched an online store on eBay in an attempt to increase donations and funds. The store sells Sufra branded items such as T-shirts pen holders and trolley coins.

437027,Varroa destructor,Identification,"Until recently ''V. destructor'' was thought to be a closely related mite species called ''Varroa jacobsoni''. Both species parasitize the Asian honey bee ''A. cerana''. However the species originally described as ''V. jacobsoni'' by Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans in 1904 is not the same species that also attacks ''Apis mellifera''. The jump to ''A. mellifera'' probably first took place in the Philippines in the early 1960s where imported ''A. mellifera'' came into close contact with infected ''A. cerana''. Until 2000 scientists had not identified ''V. destructor'' as a separate species. This late identification in 2000 by Anderson and Trueman corrected some previous confusion and mislabeling in the scientific literature.

38760,Central venous catheter,Insertion,"Video of an ultrasound-assisted central line insertion through the internal jugular vein
Before insertion the patient is first assessed by reviewing relevant labs and indication for CVC placement in order to minimize risks and complications of the procedure.  Next the area of skin over the planned insertion site is cleaned. A local anesthetic is applied if necessary. The location of the vein is identified by landmarks or with the use of a small ultrasound device. A hollow needle is advanced through the skin until blood is aspirated. The color of the blood and the rate of its flow help distinguish it from arterial blood (suggesting that an artery has been accidentally punctured). Within North American and Europe ultrasound use now represents the gold standard for central venous access and skills with diminishing use of landmark techniques. Recent evidence shows that ultrasound-guidance for subclavian vein catheterization leads to a reduction in adverse events.

The line is then inserted using the Seldinger technique: a blunt guidewire is passed through the needle then the needle is removed. A dilating device may be passed over the guidewire to expand the tract.  Finally the central line itself is then passed over the guidewire which is then removed. All the lumens of the line are aspirated (to ensure that they are all positioned inside the vein) and flushed with either saline or heparin. A chest X-ray may be performed afterwards to confirm that the line is positioned inside the superior vena cava and no pneumothorax was caused inadvertently. On anteroposterior X-rays a catheter tip between 55 and 29 mm below the level of the carina is regarded as acceptable placement. Electromagnetic tracking can be used to verify tip placement and provide guidance during insertion obviating the need for the X-ray afterwards.

164984,Bathala,Bathala in other cultures and ethnic groups,"In ancient Bicol Bathala was worshipped as a minor deity represented by a small image which they always carried for good luck; according to Lisboa (1628 61) ""they say it was an anito that brought good luck to one it accompanied"". Thus if a man was never hit by objects thrown at him he was said to be ''batalaan''.

Some scholars also identified Bathala with the Sambal deity ""Mallari"" (Mayari) though according to San Nicolas (1664 420) Bathala Mey kapal (Maykapal) was also listed among their deities whose false genealogies and fabulous deeds they celebrated in certain tunes and verses like hymns which William Henry Scott wrote may due to the influences of the Tagalogs in their culture or beliefs.

An ancient Visayan invocation goes:


1.	''Bathala origin of the first creatures ''
''Lives in the high mountains; ''
''In your two hands''
''Resides the generator-''
''Maniliw who is a witch. ''
''Tall like the trunk''
''Of the coconut; ''
''Solid like rock; ''
''Voracious like fire; ''
''Fierce more than the mad perverse dog. ''
''From your breast''
''The generator Lulid''
''Went forth. ''

''It is he''
''Who does what he likes; ''
''Who darkens''
''More than the night-''
''Like the stalk of the Palay; ''
''And Sometimes''
''As if by means of rays of light ''
''Shoots the witches like an arrow. ''
''Your living among the pygmies. ''
''Destroy oh those bad characters''
''Of the generator Kamakala. ''

2.	''Bathala thou art oh little bird Adarna! ''
''Oh thou who art nestled in that encumbered home-''
''The abode of hawks and eagles ''
''Descend we pray thee to earth ''
''With all thy multicolored feathers''
''And thy silken feathery tail-''
''Descend! Descend!-to earth. ''
''Oh thou bright-winged little bird! ''
''Celestial gift arth thou prepared for the earth-''
''Our life's source our mother devoted. ''
''Verily thou hast suffered pains in those confines''
''Of mountains craggy and precipitous-''
''Searching for lakes of emerald now vanished. ''
''Ferocious animals''
''Art thine mother''
''Oh venerable Mount Kanlaon-''
''The ruler of the people of the mountain.''



''Bathala pinunuan sang mga ''
''una nga mga inanak ''
''Dito mag estar sa mga layog''
''Sa anang alima na tagsa''

''Si ama Lulid Amo; ''

''Kon tunay sa boot niya ''
''Nga mag bulit labing''
''Kagab-ihon mapilong…''

;Tagalog translation
''Bathalang pinagmulan ng''

''Nakatira ka sa mga bundok''
''Sa kamay mo nakalagay''

120305,MEDLINE,Usage,"PubMed usage has been on the rise since 2008. In 2011 PubMed/MEDLINE was searched 1.8 billion times up from 1.6 billion searches in the previous year.

A service such as MEDLINE strives to balance usability with power and comprehensiveness. In keeping with the fact that MEDLINE's primary user community is professionals (medical scientists health care providers) searching MEDLINE effectively is a learned skill; untrained users are sometimes frustrated with the large numbers of articles returned by simple searches. Counterintuitively a search that returns thousands of articles is not guaranteed to be comprehensive. Unlike using a typical Internet search engine PubMed searching of MEDLINE requires a little investment of time. Using the MeSH database to define the subject of interest is one of the most useful ways to improve the quality of a search. Using MeSH terms in conjunction with limits (such as publication date or publication type) qualifiers (such as adverse effects or prevention and control) and text-word searching is another. Finding one article on the subject and clicking on the ""Related Articles"" link to get a collection of similarly classified articles can expand a search that otherwise yields few results.

For lay users who are trying to learn about health and medicine topics the NIH offers MedlinePlus; thus although such users are still free to search and read the medical literature themselves (via PubMed) they also have some help with curating it into something comprehensible and practically applicable for patients and family members.

304302,Hate Crew Deathroll,Reception,"Upon its release ''Hate Crew Deathroll'' directly hit first place on the Finnish album charts where it remained for 2 weeks and then slowly moved down the list until the smoke out in March 2003 after 9 weeks. In France the album reached 74th place and stayed on the charts for 2 weeks. In Sweden it was on 36th place after 2 weeks.

In Germany the album started at 45th place but quickly fell to 68th and then to 92nd place before finally falling out of the list. After the release of ''Hate Crew Deathroll'' the band experienced a growing interest from several leading mainstream media such as MTV where the video for the song ""Needled 24/7"" aired on ''Headbanger's Ball''.

Allmusic has designated ''Hate Crew Deathroll'' as Children of Bodom's best-ever album describing it as an album that is ""particularly worth listening to"". Conversely many incarnate fans criticized the album and called it worse than its predecessors. Some of the criticism was directed towards its curious song titles which have been called rogue. Laiho has responded by saying that they are merely black humor and that he cannot understand people who take music too seriously.

Generally it is considered to be more mainstream-oriented than the rest of Children of Bodom's works which may be due to the close cooperation with the UMG.

As of November 2008 the album has sold 23566 copies in Finland and was certified gold the same year as it was released.

The '''Sogdian language''' was an Eastern Iranian language spoken in the Central Asian region of Sogdia located in modern-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan (capital: Samarkand; other chief cities: Panjakent Fergana Khujand and Bukhara) as well as some Sogdian immigrant communities in ancient China. Sogdian is one of the most important Middle Iranian languages along with Bactrian Khotanese Saka Middle Persian and Parthian. It possesses a large literary corpus.

The Sogdian language is usually assigned to a Northeastern group of the Iranian languages although this is a Sprachbund rather than a genetic group. No direct evidence of an earlier version of the language (""Old Sogdian"") has been found although mention of the area in the Old Persian inscriptions means that a separate and recognisable Sogdia existed at least since the Achaemenid Empire (559–323 BCE).

Like Khotanese Sogdian possesses a more conservative grammar and morphology than Middle Persian. The modern Eastern Iranian language Yaghnobi is the descendant of a dialect of Sogdian spoken around the 8th century in Ustrashana a region to the south of Sogdia.

People have been shooting military rifles at targets for at least 150 years.  Much of this activity ended up as the strictly deliberate target shooting of the NRA.  Those who wanted to shoot authentically configured military rifles at targets but with more action than NRA shooting initiated Service Rifle shooting.  Several clubs round NZ were doing this in an uncoordinated way. In late 1997 the International Military Arms Society Inc based in Auckland and Wellington Service Rifle Association formed the New Zealand Service Rifle Association Inc.  A joint set of rules and matches was written and called the Service Match Code now in its fourth edition.  Currently the main clubs running exclusively Service Rifle matches are Wellington Service Rifle Association Inc (WSRA) and Auckland Service Rifle Association Inc (ASRA).  Other clubs (BOPSRA Waikato Rifle Bruce Rifle Club Canterbury group) also run SR matches as part of their overall programme.

105238,Woolwich Arsenal station,History,"
The station opened in 1849 serving the North Kent Line from London to Gillingham. The station building was rebuilt in 1906 with a London brick-built structure very typical of southeast London. The current station building dates from 1992-93 and has a modern design in steel and glass by the Architecture and Design Group of British Rail under the leadership of Nick Derbyshire. It has a circular theme quite different from what existed before.

Woolwich Arsenal was expanded in 2009 when Transport for London completed the construction of an extension of the London City Airport branch of the Docklands Light Railway from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal which is the branch's new terminus. The official opening took place on 12 January 2009.

In 2014 a petition was started and presented to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to rezone Woolwich Arsenal station from Zone 4 to Zone 3. However Johnson ruled this out stating it would cause losses in over a million pounds per annum.

614358,Drop (music),Types,"===Electronic dance music===
Many genres of EDM can have more than one drop during a track especially if the song is built on a ""dance-pop"" verse/chorus with vocals; a drop of some kind is typically heard somewhere during each chorus as the high point of that verse/chorus cycle. Most genres however tend to emphasize a single drop as the beginning of the high point or climax of the entire track; in vocal subgenres this is typically the last repetition of the chorus while in nonvocal genres it typically occurs in the last quarter of the track.

* In trance eurodance hardstyle hardcore progressive house funky house and dance genres of the more melodic style it is known as a climax. This is where the melody and accompanying melodies come in with the drums and usually a syncopated bassline giving the track a 'bouncy' feel.
* In dubstep the drop involves a heavy full bass line and commonly a ""wobble"" or ""vowel"" bass accompanied by a strong shuffling beat. In other dubstep styles there can be powerful chords and/or emotional melodies combined with varies of common dubstep bass lines.
* Electronic music DJs sometimes perform what is called a ""double drop"": beatmatching two tracks in such a way that the drop and hence the respective climaxes of both tracks occur at the same time.
===Hip hop===
In hip hop and other forms of electronic music a reintroduction of the full bass line and drums after pulling them back for a verse or buildup is known as a drop. There are usually more than one in songs from these genres; the first drop and the climax are particularly emphasized. 
===Metalcore===
In metalcore subgenres bass drops are often utilized under the first chord of a breakdown to emphasize the breakdown and give it a pronounced presence. A bass drop in this genre may be done using a electronic drums with a sample pad triggered by the drummer or a backing track either which is sent to a venue's PA system.

===Rock and pop===
* In rock music the drop is characterized by an increase in the speed or activity of the bassline and usually a big boost to volume in the keyboard or guitar and/or adding distortion or overdrive to the rhythm guitar. The song's volume and tempo change.
*In pop music ''Billboard'' magazine states that in 2016 the ""pop-drop"" is the ""...post-chorus musical interlude that blends techniques from electronic dance music to hip-hop and it's taken the chorus' place in pop music. The pop-drop is the new climax of the song right where we would expect to hear the chorus and it is absolutely everywhere...It's set up by what's known as the ""pre-chorus"" which typically cues a sing-along refrain. Then where we expect the chorus we get yet another section of build a kind of pseudo-chorus that further heightens expectations. Finally the pop-drop lands. The singer literally drops out replaced by synthesizers and chopped-up distorted vocal samples that vaguely reference the earlier lyrics"" over a syncopated beat."

A wider field for his activity presented itself in 1848 (along with the Austrian Revolution). First he attempted to hold Vienna against the imperial troops of Alfred I Prince of Windisch-Grätz and after the capitulation hastened to Pressburg ( today Bratislava Slovakia) to offer his services to Lajos Kossuth first defending himself in a long speech from the accusations of ""treachery to the Polish cause"" and ""aristocratic tendencies"" ˙— which the more fanatical section of the Polish émigré Radicals repeatedly brought against him. He was entrusted with the defence of Transylvania at the end of 1848 and in 1849 as General of the Székely troops he performed miracles with his little army notably at the bridge of Piski on February 9 where after fighting all day he drove back an immense force of pursuers.

After relieving Transylvania he was sent to drive the Austrian General Anton Freiherr von Puchner out of the Banat region. Bem defeated him at Orşova on May 16 but the Russian invasion forced him to retreat to Transylvania. From July 12 to 22 he was fighting continually but finally on July 31 his army was annihilated by overwhelming numbers in the Battle of Segesvár (near Segesvár now Sighişoara Romania) Bem escaping only after feigning death. Yet he fought a fresh action at Nagycsür (now ) on August 6 and contrived to bring his fragmented army to the Battle of Temesvár (near Temesvár now Timişoara Romania) to aid the hard-pressed General Henryk Dembiński. Bem was in command and was seriously wounded in the last pitched battle of the war fought there on August 9.

'''Pragmatics''' is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning. Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory conversational implicature talk in interaction and other approaches to language behavior in philosophy sociology linguistics and anthropology. Unlike semantics which examines meaning that is conventional or ""coded"" in a given language pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g. grammar lexicon etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance any pre-existing knowledge about those involved the inferred intent of the speaker and other factors.  In this respect pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity since meaning relies on the manner place time etc. of an utterance.

The ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called ''pragmatic competence''.

176278,Rothko Chapel,History,"In 1964 Rothko was commissioned by John and Dominique de Menil (also founders of the nearby Menil Collection) to create a meditative space filled with his paintings. The works are site-specific one of the requirements of the program.  As Rothko was given creative license on the design of the structure he clashed with the project's original architect Philip Johnson over the plans for the chapel. The plans went through several revisions and architects. Rothko continued to work first with Howard Barnstone and then with Eugene Aubry but ultimately he did not live to see the chapel's completion in 1971. After a long struggle with depression Rothko committed suicide in his New York studio on February 25 1970.

From 1973 onward the Rothko Chapel doubled as a center for colloquiums aimed at fostering mutual understanding on issues affecting justice and freedom throughout the world. The first colloquium drew scholars from Lebanon Iran India Pakistan Nigeria Japan Italy the United States and Canada.  In 1981 it initiated “The Rothko Chapel Awards to Commitment to Truth and Freedom."" In 1986 a second award was established to honor and emulate the spirit of Oscar Romero Archbishop of San Salvador who was murdered on March 24 1980. These Rothko Chapel Awards have recognized individuals and organizations who at great risk denounce violations of human rights. In 1991 the Rothko Chapel marked its 20th anniversary with a joint award with the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation founded in 1986 with former President Jimmy Carter. Nelson Mandela was the keynote speaker and received the special Rothko Chapel award.

In early 1999 the Rothko Chapel closed for a major renovation. The paintings had been exhibiting premature signs of age and the largest could not be removed for treatment. In 2000 the chapel reopened after an 18-month $1.8 million renovation with the artist's paintings newly restored.

Elefante discovered another calling while still with Kansas—record producer. In 1984 he produced ''Perfect Timing'' for ground-breaking Southern California group Sweet Comfort Band. While not a major commercial success Petra's ''Back to the Street'' was a Grammy-nominated breakthrough commercial success for both Elefante and the band. He also contributed songwriting keyboards background vocals and engineering to the effort.

With both John and Dino Elefante as the band's primary producers Petra's already popular Christian pop/rock niche was given a timely boost. Their accolades include multiple gold albums 10 consecutive CCM Magazine Reader's Choice Awards induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and Hard Rock Cafe and the only artist to ever have four albums in the SoundScan top-100 Christian chart.

In 1987 while producing a various artists album called California Metal the album's production team of John and Dino Elefante ended up one track short and they decided to add a song written for Kansas called ""Wasn't It Love"" (originally entitled ""What About Love"") under the name Mastedon. Regency later requested a full-length album which became Mastedon's debut ''It's a Jungle Out There''.

Closing out the decade Elefante had produced five major label albums and performed on 12. Over the next five years Elefante worked at an almost frenetic pace as one of the most in-demand producers in Nashville. In addition to Petra's further releases he worked as the producer on 30 other albums. He usually performed on the releases as well often sharing songwriting credits as well. Elefante was committed to his role as producer eschewing other opportunities such as an offer to replace Bobby Kimball as lead singer for Grammy winners Toto.

294518,Superheated steam,Introduction,"
'''Superheated steam''' is a steam at a temperature higher than its vaporization (boiling) point at the absolute pressure where the temperature is measured.

The steam can therefore cool (lose internal energy) by some amount resulting in a lowering of its temperature without changing state (i.e. condensing) from a gas to a mixture of saturated vapor and liquid.  If saturated steam (a mixture of both gas and saturated vapor) is heated at constant pressure its temperature will also remain constant as the vapor quality (think dryness or percent saturated vapor) increases towards 100% and becomes dry (i.e. no saturated liquid) saturated steam. Continued heat input will then ""super"" heat the dry saturated steam. This will occur if saturated steam contacts a surface with a higher temperature.

Superheated steam and liquid water cannot coexist under thermodynamic equilibrium as any additional heat simply evaporates more water and the steam will become saturated steam. However this restriction may be violated temporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated steam in a power plant or for processes (such as drying paper) the saturated steam drawn from a boiler is passed through a separate heating device (a superheater) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by radiation.

Superheated steam is not suitable for sterilization.  This is because the superheated steam is dry. Dry steam must reach much higher temperatures and the materials exposed for a longer time period to have the same effectiveness; or equal F0 kill value. Superheated steam is also not useful for heating. Saturated steam has a much higher wall heat transfer coefficient.

Slightly superheated steam may be used for antimicrobial disinfection of biofilms on hard surfaces.

Superheated steam’s greatest value lies in its tremendous internal energy that can be used for kinetic reaction through mechanical expansion against turbine blades and reciprocating pistons that produces rotary motion of a shaft.  The value of superheated steam in these applications is its ability to release tremendous quantities of internal energy yet remain above the condensation temperature of water vapor; at the pressures at which reaction turbines and reciprocating piston engines operate.

Of prime importance in these applications is the fact that water vapor containing entrained liquid droplets is generally incompressible at those pressures.  If steam doing work in a reciprocating engine or turbine cools to a temperature at which liquid droplets form; the water droplets entrained in the fluid flow will strike the mechanical parts of engines or turbines with enough force to bend crack or fracture them. Superheating and pressure reduction through expansion ensures that the steam flow remains as a compressible gas throughout its passage through a turbine or an engine preventing damage of the internal moving parts.

155698,Kirkcaldy,History,"

===Toponymy===
The name Kirkcaldy means ""place of the hard fort"" or ""place of Caled's fort"". It is derived from the Pictish '''' meaning ""fort"" '''' which is Pictish ""hard"" or a personal name and ''-in'' a suffix meaning ""place of"". '''' may describe the fort itself or be an epithet for a local ""hard"" ruler. An interpretation of the last element as ''din'' (again meaning ""fort"" but from Gaelic) rather than ''-n'' is incorrect. The Old Statistical Account gives a derivation from culdee which has been repeated in later publications but this is also incorrect.

===Early===
The discovery of 11 Bronze Age cist burials which date from 2500 BC and 500 BC suggests that this is the most ancient funerary site in the area. What probably made this location ideal was its natural terraces stretching away from the sand bay and the close proximity of the East Burn to the north and the West (Tiel) Burn to the south. Four Bronze Age burials dating from around 4000 BC have also been found around the site of the unmarked Bogely or Dysart Standing Stone to the east of the present A92 road. Although there are few Roman sites in Fife a Roman camp was known to exist at Carberry Farm on the town's outskirts.

The Battle of Raith in AD 596 is believed to have taken place to the west of the town's site. The battle was fought between the Angles and an alliance led by King Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata of Scots Picts and Britons.

=== Medieval ===
The first document to recognise the town was issued in 1075 when the King of Scots Malcolm III (reigned 1058–93) granted the shire of Kirkcaladunt among other gifts to the church at Dunfermline. The residents were expected to pay dues and taxes for the church's general upkeep. Two charters later confirmed by Malcolm's son David I in 1128 and 1130 refer to Kircalethin and Kirkcaladunit respectively but do not indicate their locations.

In 1304 a weekly market and annual fair for Kirkcaldy was proposed by the Abbot of Dunfermline to King Edward I during a period of English rule in Scotland from 1296 to 1306. The reason given for these discussions was that the town may have been referred to as ""one of the most ancient of burghs"". This status as a burgh dependent on Dunfermline Abbey was later confirmed in 1327 by Robert I King of Scots (reigned 1306–29).

A charter granted in 1363 by David II King of Scots (reigned 1329–71) awarded the burgh the right to trade across the regality of Dunfermline. This charter allowed the burgesses of Kirkcaldy to purchase and sell goods to the burgesses of the three other regality burghs—Queensferry Dunfermline and Musselburgh—that belonged to the Abbey. By 1451 Kirkcaldy was awarded feu-ferme status. Under the status responsibility would now lie with the bailies and council to deal with the routine administration of the town and its fiscal policies; conditional on an annual payment of two and a half marks (33s 4d or £1.67) to the Abbot of Dunfermline.

===16th to 18th centuries===
At the beginning of the 16th century the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries the Baltic region England and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established or whether it was always located at the mouth of the East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16th century timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides wool skins herring salmon coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17th century.

A charter issued by Charles I granting royal burgh status in 1644 led to the full independence of the town. As a gesture the king gave  of common muir suitable for ""bleaching of linen drying of clothes recreation and perpetuity"" to the town. In 1638 under the reign of Charles I the town subscribed to the National Covenant which opposed the introduction of episocopacy and patronage in the Presbyterian church. Support for the Covenanting cause cost the town over 250 men at the Battle of Kilsyth in 1645. The continuing civil wars killed at least another 480 men and led to the loss of many of the harbour's trading vessels. By 1660 this left the town with only twelve registered ships down from 100 it is claimed were recorded between 1640 and 1644.

Towards the end of the 17th century the economy recovered with growth in manufacturing. During this period Daniel Defoe described Kirkcaldy as a ""larger more populous and better built town than ... any on this coast"". A shipbuilding revival produced 38 vessels between 1778 and 1793. In the mid-19th century whaling became important to the town for a short time. In 1813 the first Kirkcaldy whaling ship ''The Earl Percy'' sailed north to the Davis Strait; the town's last whaler ''The Brilliant'' was sold in 1866 to Peterhead bringing an end to the industry. Construction of a new turnpike from Pettycur to Newport-on-Tay via Cupar in 1790 while improving only one section of Fife's isolated road system brought a huge increase in traffic along Kirkcaldy's High Street and helped to strengthen the town's position.
Remains of the common muir now known as Volunteers' Green

===Modern===
For most of the 19th century the main industries in the town were flax spinning and linen weaving. To cope with increasing imports of flax timber and hemp and exports of coal salt and linen between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer Michael Nairn took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent for the production of floorcloth and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876 Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883 employing 1300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908 for another increase in linoleum and coal.

The expansion of the town led in 1876 to the extension of the royal burgh's boundaries. The town absorbed its neighbouring settlements of Linktown in the parish of Abbotshall; Invertiel in the parish of Kinghorn; and Pathhead Sinclairtown and Gallatown in the parish of Dysart. These formerly separate settlements had once been forbidden by the old guild rights to sell their goods in Kirkcaldy. In 1922–1923 a seawall and esplanade were constructed funded by the Unemployment Grants Commission and built by unemployed residents. In 1930 the town expanded to include the former royal burgh of Dysart.

During the 1950s and 1960s new housing estates were built north-west of the town. This was followed by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population from a peak of 53750 in 1961 to 47962 in 1981.

In the 21st century Kirkcaldy remains an important centre for the surrounding areas with a Museum and Art Gallery three public parks and shopping facilities. The town also hosts the annual Links Market commonly known as ''Europe's longest street fair''. The production of linoleum continues though on a greatly reduced scale under Swiss ownership (Forbo Holding AG). Kirkcaldy Harbour which closed in 1992 re-opened in October 2011 to cargo ships. A project between Carr's Flour Mills the parent of Hutchison's Forth Ports (owners of the harbour) and Transport Scotland will allow Carr's to bring in wheat via the harbour and remove a quarter of its lorries from the roads every year.

He wrote extensively on the need for individual initiative—''virtu''—as an essential characteristic of stable government. He argued that liberty was the central good which government should protect and that ""good people"" would make good laws whereas people who had lost their virtue could maintain their liberties only with difficulty. His Discourses on Livy outlined realism as the central idea of political study and favored ""Republics"" over ""Principalities"".

Anti-statist liberals consider Machiavelli's distrust as his main message noting his call for a strong state under a strong leader who should use any means to establish his position whereas liberalism is an ideology of individual freedom and voluntary choices.

Desiderius Erasmus
'''Desiderius Erasmus''' (Netherlands 1466–1536) was an advocate of humanism critic of entrenched interests irrationality and superstition. Erasmusian societies formed across Europe to some extent in response to the turbulence of the Reformation.
In his ''De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio'' (1524) he analyzes the Lutheran exaggeration of the obvious limitations on human freedom.

===Thomas Hobbes===
Thomas Hobbes
'''Thomas Hobbes''' (England 1588–1679) theorized that government is the result of individual actions and human traits and that it was motivated primarily by ""interest"" a term which would become crucial in the development of a liberal theory of government and political economy since it is the foundation of the idea that individuals can be self-governing and self-regulating. His work ''Leviathan'' did not advocate this viewpoint but instead that only a strong government could restrain unchecked interest: it did however advance a proto-liberal position in arguing for an inalienable ""right of nature"" the right to defend oneself even against the state. Though it is problematic to classify Hobbes himself as a liberal his work influenced Locke Hamilton Jefferson Madison and many other later liberals leading Strauss to identify Hobbes as the ""father of liberalism"".

===Baruch Spinoza===
'''Baruch Spinoza''' (Netherlands 1632–1677) is in his ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' and ''Tractatus Politicus'' a proto-liberal defending the value of separation of church and state as well as forms of democracy. In the first mentioned book Spinoza expresses an early criticism of religious intolerance and a defense of secular government. Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of necessity. For him even human behaviour is fully determined freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say ""no"" to what happens to us but the possibility to say ""yes"" and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way.

630023,Defiance Ohio (band),History,"
Defiance Ohio formed in 2002 as a three piece in Columbus Ohio with Geoff on guitar Ryan on Bass and Will on drums. By the time they recorded their first demo bz joined on violin and Sherri on cello. Their first album ''Share What Ya Got'' was self released on CDr and on vinyl by Friends and Relatives. It was later reissued on vinyl by No Idea. The band moved to Bloomington Indiana released two split EPs with Ghost Mice and One Reason and toured the US extensively as well as Iceland. In 2004 Will moved to Eureka California and Theo Hilton filled in on drums. Will returned from California and Theo stayed with the band switching back and forth on drums and guitar.

''The Great Depression'' was released in 2006 on No Idea. After making the decisions to work with No Idea the band felt a need to explain their actions and maintain the sense of dialogue that they feel has been consistent in how they have conducted themselves as a band. They said that they would have preferred to release the album themselves but that they did not have the capacity to do so while continuing to keep older releases in print.

In 2007 the band released a split EP with Environmental Youth Crunch and a full-length ''The Fear The Fear The Fear'' on No Idea. Theo moved the Athens Georgia while the band continued to practice tour and write together and they toured Australia for the first time.

In 2009 the band released 4 songs as a benefit for the Icarus Project. These songs were later remastered and released as part of the full-length ''Midwestern Minutes'' in 2010. Geoff relocated to Chicago. Due to band members moving to different cities and starting other musical projects activity has slowed down in recent years compared to consistent and extensive touring of earlier years. Their latest release is a 6-song EP ''The Calling'' on No Idea. Their last tour was in 2015.

Most of the members of Defiance Ohio also participate in other bands such as Nana Grizol Pretty Hot Landlord Pink Houses Hymns Disaster High Dive Memento Mori (now defunct) and other musical projects. Ryan Woods the bassist is also part-owner of the popular vegetarian restaurant The Owlery in Bloomington Indiana.

23509,Tom Jones (singer),Early life,"Jones was born Thomas John Woodward  at 57 Kingsland Terrace Treforest Pontypridd in Glamorgan South Wales. His parents were Thomas Woodward (31 March 1910 – 5 October 1981) a coal miner and Freda Jones (30 December 1914 – 7 February 2003). Three of his grandparents were of English origin: his paternal grandfather James Woodward was an ironmonger's haulier from Gloucestershire and his paternal grandmother Anne Woodward was from Wiltshire. His maternal grandfather Albert Jones was Welsh and his maternal grandmother Ada Jones was born in Pontypridd to parents from Somerset and Wiltshire.

Jones attended Wood Road Infants School Wood Road Junior School and Pontypridd Central Secondary Modern School. He began singing at an early age: He would regularly sing at family gatherings weddings and in his school choir. Jones did not like school or sports but gained confidence through his singing talent. At 12 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Many years later he said: ""I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life."" During convalescence he could do little else but listen to music and draw.

Jones's bluesy singing style developed out of the sound of American soul music. His early influences included blues and R&B singers Little Richard Solomon Burke Jackie Wilson and Brook Benton as well as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.

In March 1957 Jones married his high school girlfriend Linda Trenchard when they were expecting a child together both aged 16. The couple's son Mark was born in the month following their wedding. To support his young family Jones took a job working in a glove factory and was later employed in construction.

285820,Cape Spear,Cape Spear Lighthouse National Historic Site,"

===History===
The Cape Spear region was originally inhabited by Beothuk peoples. Additionally Mi’kmaq communities practiced a non-sedentary presence in the area harvesting subsistence resources on a temporary basis prior to permanent residency at settlements such as St. George’s Bay and Conne River from the nineteenth century onwards. In contrast to European settlers who viewed the cape as a place of significance as the easternmost point in Canada there is no known archaeological evidence to indicate that Cape Spear was viewed by local Indigenous communities as a place of symbolic geographical importance. According to Fife and Roseman historically there are “no indications that either the Beothuk or the Mi’kmaq equated Cape Spear with a ‘land’s end’ that was meaningful to them.”

A lighthouse has operated at Cape Spear since September 1836. The original Cape Spear lighthouse was the second lighthouse built in Newfoundland; the first was built in 1810 at Fort Amherst at the entrance to St. John's Harbour.
In 1832 the first legislative assembly for the colony created a lighthouse board. Cape Spear was chosen as the site for a new lighthouse because it was on the rocky eastern coast near the entrance to St John's harbor.

Nicholas Croke and William Parker two St. John's builders won the contract for the lighthouse and work began in 1834 or early in 1835. The first lighthouse was a square wooden building with a tower in the middle containing the light. A foghorn was added in 1878. The first light used at Cape Spear had already been used since 1815 at a lighthouse at Inchkeith on the east coast of Scotland. This light used seven Argand burners and curved reflectors. This was later replaced by a dioptric lens system; the light was first lit by oil then acetylene and finally electricity in 1930.

World War II battery
Because of its proximity to convoy routes during the Second World War a gun battery including two Lend-Lease ex-US 10-inch M1888 guns on disappearing carriages was installed at Cape Spear to defend the entrance to St. John's harbor. Barracks and underground passages leading to the bunkers were built for the use of troops stationed there. The gun barrels remain in place.

===Current===
A new concrete building was built to house the light in 1955. The lighthouse is the oldest surviving lighthouse in Newfoundland and the location has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.  The original lighthouse building and the light keeper's residence have since been restored to the period of 1839 and are open to the public. The visitor centre includes a gift shop. The lighthouse was designated under the federal Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act in June 2016.

The World War II bunkers and gun barrels that are located at the site afford a sheltered view of the ocean.

Some visitors attracted by the scenery and history have been swept away by the large and unpredictable waves at Cape Spear prompting Parks Canada to post numerous warning signs in the area.

459399,Begemder,Etymology,"There are several proposed etymologies for the name ''Begemder''. One is that it came from ''Bega'' (Beja) plus ''meder'' (land) (meaning land of the Bega or Beja) as an inscription of Emperor Ezana of Aksum describes his movement of 4400 conquered Beja to a not yet located province named ''Matlia''. 

A perhaps more plausible source for the name ''Bega'' is the self-name of the word ''Bega'' which means dry in the local language or another possible interpretation could be ""sheep"" where rearing of sheep which is called ''beg'' in Amharic in the.  Thus ''Begemder'' likely refers to 'land of that rear sheep or The land of Dry area"".

Another etymology is that the first two syllables come from the Ge'ez language ''baggi`'' for sheep (Amharic: ''beg'') although Beke claimed that sheep have never been pastured there nor could they be raised there. Beckingham and Huntingford note that Begemder originally applied to the country east of Lake Tana where water is scarce and conclude ""The allusion to the lack of water suggests Amharic ''baga'' ""dry season"" as a possible source of the name.""

46830,Red Skull,Other versions,"
===Earth-110===
Red Skull allied with Doctor Doom Hulk Magneto Namor and Ultron in order to take over Manhattan.

===Heroes Reborn===
In the Heroes Reborn universe Red Skull is revealed to be the banker of the Master Man's World Party. This version references his fights with Captain America during World War II but is stopped by Nick Fury Captain America and Falcon.

===JLA/Avengers===
Red Skull appears briefly as one of the foes defending Krona's stronghold in issue #4 and is defeated by Jay Garrick the Golden Age Flash.

===Earth X===
Johann Schmidt was killed by Captain America some time previous to Earth X. After Red Skull killed Bernie Rosenthal and then hailed Captain America as the realization of the Nazi dream Captain America decapitated the Red Skull using his trademark shield. As a result of his disillusionment from taking a life Captain America retired from the Avengers only to further spiral into depression after the Avengers were killed in Washington D.C. Schmidt was later seen in the Land of the Dead and then as one of those in Mar-Vell's Paradise waiting to live in his own personal version of Heaven.

Despite his death Red Skull's legacy lived on in the Earth X universe. Ben Beckley took on the '''Skull''' identity (not the Red Skull as he had no idea who Red Skull was) and set out to conquer the world starting with a coast-to-coast drive across America. Using his power of control over the cerebrum (and thereby actions) of anyone he gathered an army of thousands only to come into conflict with Steve Rogers in his Captain America identity. Insulting Captain America as old and out of date the Skull spared him but took several of Captain America's allies as part of his army. After reaching New York City Skull was opposed by Captain America and other heroes with Captain America breaking Skull's neck in order to stop him. Beckley would later be seen in the Land of the Dead with his father Comet Man and would help the heroes to convince the dead that they were deceased.

===Elseworlds===
In the 1997 DC/Marvel special ""Batman/Captain America"" Red Skull hires the Joker to steal an atomic bomb during World War II. Joker evades Batman Cap Bucky and Robin and delivers it to Red Skull but is horrified when he learns that Red Skull is a Nazi (saying ""I may be a criminal lunatic but I'm an ''American'' criminal lunatic!""). When Red Skull threatens to drop the bomb on Washington D.C. Joker actually fights him in the plane's cargo bay. When Captain America and Batman take over the plane and bring it over the ocean the two villains are dropped out with the bomb just before it explodes. Both Captain America and Batman are convinced the two are still alive somehow.

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''Marvel Zombies'' Red Skull is an undead zombie with an unquenchable hunger for the flesh of the living. In issue #5 he finally manages to kill Colonel America by scooping out the last of the Colonel's exposed brain before being decapitated by a zombified Spider-Man and his head crushed by Giant Man's boot. His last words were ""It was worth it all of it just for this"" informing that he waited many years to finally kill his long-time enemy and that even his present zombification could not stop his lust for murder.

===Old Man Logan===
In a possible future where a final battle between the heroes and villains ended with the villains winning Red Skull is revealed as the mastermind of the villains' conquest and has made himself President of the United States. Living in the Nazi redecorated White House Red Skull had taken to wearing Captain America's old bloodstained uniform and collecting gruesome trophies from fallen heroes. When his men bring in a wounded Wolverine Logan and Red Skull fight in his trophy room. Unwilling to pop his claws during the fight Wolverine decapitates Red Skull with Captain America's shield ending his villainous rule.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Red Skull shown on the variant cover to ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #1. Art by Leinil Yu.
The Ultimate Marvel version of Red Skull appears in ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' and was created by Mark Millar. This incarnation is the illegitimate son of Steve Rogers and Gail Richards and wears simple khaki pants and a white tee shirt instead of the Nazi/military costume of the 616 counterpart. After his father's presumed death during World War II he is taken from his mother and raised on an army base where he appears to be a well-adjusted physically superior and tactically brilliant young man who greatly resembles his father. However his easygoing personality is a ruse. Around the age of seventeen he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face in rejection of his father leaving a ""red skull"". As a final symbol of his rebellion against the system that created him he assassinates President John F. Kennedy. During his career he forces a woman to choose between killing her husband or her infant son.  After she kills her husband the Skull kills the child anyway and then has her viciously raped by his henchmen. After decades of working as a professional assassin Red Skull joins A.I.M. so that he and his men can steal the blueprints of the Cosmic Cube. There he finally meets Captain America and brutally beats him. Before throwing Captain America out of his helicopter Red Skull reveals his true identity. At A.I.M. headquarters in Alaska Red Skull kills the lead officer and takes charge of the operation. Now in control of the Cosmic Cube he gains great power. As a sadistic display of his power he has the entire Alaskan A.I.M. team cannibalize each other. When the Avengers arrive on the scene they immediately attack but the Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power making him absolutely invulnerable. Captain America arrives in a stolen Teleporter Jet but Red Skull forces the jet to crash. Cap survives the crash and teleports the jet to Red Skull's exact coordinates impaling him on one of the two rods that protrude from its nose. Red Skull is taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for his mother to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explains to Nick Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was to turn back time and prevent his father from being lost so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life. Petra Laskov (disguised as a nurse) enters the room and shoots Red Skull in the head killing him. Gregory Stark implies that Fury was responsible for calling Red Skull out of retirement in order to regain his position in S.H.I.E.L.D.

30029,Airbag,Limitations,"Crash test of an underride guard at ; the truck platform at head height has been prevented from impacting the windshield
Although the millions of installed airbags in use have an excellent safety record there are some limitations on their ability to protect car occupants.

The original implementation of front airbags did little to protect against side collisions which can be more dangerous than frontal collisions because the protective crumple zone in front of the passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.

Airbags are designed to deploy once only and are ineffective if there are any further collisions after an initial impact.  Multiple impacts may occur during certain rollover accidents or other incidents involving multiple collisions such as many multi-vehicle collisions.

An extremely dangerous situation occurs during ""underride collisions"" in which a passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard.  The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that there may not be much between a head and the edge of the trailer platform except a glass windshield.  In an underride collision the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed.  Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions.  Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.

Typical airbag systems are completely disabled by turning off the ignition key.  Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine power steering and power brakes and may be the direct cause of an accident.  If a violent collision occurs the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants.  In 2014 General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal accidents caused by defective ignition switches which would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags). Between 13 and 74 deaths have been directly attributed to this defect depending on how the fatalities are classified.

94188,William Ellery Channing,Life and work,"
===Early life===

Channing the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery was born April7 1780 in Newport Rhode Island. He was a grandson of William Ellery (1727–1820) a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence Deputy Governor of Rhode Island Chief Justice and influential citizen. He became a New England liberal rejecting the Calvinist doctrines of total depravity and divine election.

Channing enrolled at Harvard College at a troubled time particularly because of the recent French Revolution. He later wrote of these years:



Graduating first in his class in 1798 he was elected commencement speaker though he was prohibited by the Harvard College faculty from mentioning the Revolution and other political subjects in his address.

===As theologian===
Boston Public Garden in Boston Massachusetts

In opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy Channing preferred a gentle loving relationship with God. He opposed Calvinism for



Channing's inner struggle continued through two years during which he lived in Richmond Virginia working as a tutor for David Meade Randolph. He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty. Channing was called as pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston in 1803 where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position rejecting the extremes of both groups. In 1809 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1815 Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of Unitarianism with Samuel Worcester (1770–1821). A review of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (''American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America'') attributed to Jeremiah Evarts was published in ''The Panoplist'' in June 1815. Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review. Worcester replied to this objection and an exchange of pamphlets followed.

Notwithstanding his moderate position Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of Unitarianism after sixteen years at Boston's Federal Street Church. He was invited to come south again to Maryland to preach the ordination sermon of the future noted educator and theologian Jared Sparks (1789–1866) the first minister (1819–1823) called to the newly organized congregation (1817) in Baltimore known as the First Independent Church of Baltimore (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French émigré architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy) later known after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935 as the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist) which was forever after known as ""The Baltimore Sermon"". The sermon or address was given on Wednesday May5 1819 and was entitled ""Unitarian Christianity"". In it he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing Unitarian movement one of which was the rejection of the Trinity. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of reason. The anniversary of the address is celebrated and observed annually by the Maryland churches of the Unitarian Universalist Association and its Joseph Priestley District as ""Union Sunday"" with occasional ecumenical guests from other Christian bodies).

In 1828 he gave another famous ordination sermon entitled ""Likeness to God"". The idea of the human potential to be like God which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture was seen as heretical by the Calvinist religious establishment of his day. It is in this address that Channing first advocated the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who ""took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.""

Even at the end of his life he adhered to the non-Socinian belief in the preexistence of Christ:



===Later years===

In later years Channing addressed the topic of slavery although he was never an ardent abolitionist. Channing wrote a book in 1835 entitled ''Slavery.'' Channing has however been described as a romantic racist. He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed Africans would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy. Therefore he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements. This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England and America in the nineteenth century.

Toward the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British abolition in the British West Indies in 1834 and the absence of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated Caribbean.

Channing wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the United States saying that national literature is ""the expression of a nation's mind in writing"" and ""the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy"".

In addition to hiking camping fishing and backpacking the following attractions are highlights with many park visitors:

*'''Sherman Tree Trail''' An 0.8-mile roundtrip paved trail that descends from the parking lot to the base of the General Sherman tree and meanders through a grove of giant sequoia trees.
*'''Tunnel Log''' is a fallen giant sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park. The tree which measured  tall and  in diameter fell across a park road in 1937 due to natural causes. The following year a crew cut an  tall  wide tunnel through the trunk making the road passable again.
*'''Tokopah Falls''' The trail to Tokopah Falls starts just beyond the Marble Fork Bridge in Lodgepole Campground. It is an easy 1.7 mile (one way) walk along the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River to the impressive granite cliffs and waterfall of Tokopah Canyon. Tokopah Falls is 1200 feet (365.8 meters) high and is most impressive in early summer.
*'''Crescent Meadow''' is a small sequoia-rimmed meadow in the Giant Forest region of Sequoia National Park. This sierran montane meadow marks the western terminus of the High Sierra Trail which stretches from the meadow across the Great Western Divide to Mount Whitney. Pioneer Hale Tharp homesteaded in this and nearby Log Meadow. Conservationist John Muir visited this meadow many times and praised it highly calling it the ""Gem of the Sierras"". The meadow lies at the end of a three-mile paved road which leaves the Generals Highway near the Giant Forest Museum.
*'''Moro Rock''' is a granite dome located in the center of the park at the head of Moro Creek between Giant Forest and Crescent Meadow. A 400-step stairway built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps is cut into and poured onto the rock so that visitors can hike to the top. The stairway is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The view from the rock encompasses much of the Park including the Great Western Divide. It has an elevation of .
* '''Campgrounds''' in the park include three in the foothills area: Potwisha (42 sites) Buckeye Flat (28 sites) and South Fork (10 sites). Four campgrounds are at higher conifer-dominated elevations ranging from : Atwell Mill (21 sites) Cold Springs (40 sites) Lodgepole (214 sites) and Dorst Creek (204 sites).
* '''Giant Forest Museum''' offers information about giant sequoias and human history in the forest.  The historic museum was built in 1928 by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood.

345479,Robert C. Richardson III,Atomic weapons and the evolution of theater nuclear warfare,"From his experience thinking of and drafting NATO’s nuclear war plans under President Eisenhower’s emphasis on atomic defense to counter Soviet conventional superiority led him in 1955 to publish a series of articles on nuclear and atomic warfare in the ''Air University Review.''  As a result Col Richardson had become an acknowledged military expert in nuclear warfare and a regular lecturer on the subject at the National Defense College and Air War College. In January 1958 he was transferred to Headquarters U.S. Air Force to become assistant for Long Range Objectives to the deputy chief of staff/plans and programs. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1960.

With the installation of the new Kennedy Administration Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara directed the dismantlement of the Air Force and Navy long range plans staffs and ordered the services’ long range planning experts out of Washington and into the field. This along with imposing a more restrictive editorial policy on the military services’ strategy journals removed the services’ key thinkers from the Washington debates arising from the administration’s new strategic direction with regard to military procurement and military strategy development. As a result in June 1961 Gen Richardson was transferred to the Military Assistance Division Headquarters U.S. European Command Paris France and upon arrival was detailed by General Norstad as director of operations for Live Oak the Tripartite Berlin Plans and Operations Group air force team that coordinated and executed the NATO air responses to the Soviet attempts close down the Berlin air corridors during the Berlin Crisis.

292876,Xinerama,Known problems,"
===Common color depth===
Xinerama requires that all of the physical screens have the same bit depth. For example an 8-bit screen cannot be combined with a 16-bit screen.

===Hardware rendering===
In some implementations OpenGL direct-rendering only works on one screen. Windows that should show 3D graphics on other screens tend to appear black a problem most commonly seen with 3D screen savers. The Solaris SPARC OpenGL implementation and ATI and nVidia proprietary Linux drivers support hardware-accelerated rendering of all screens in Xinerama mode.

===Static configuration===
Physical screens cannot be added or removed dynamically and there is no way to change the resolution of a screen. This is particularly difficult for mobile computer users who may use an external physical display in addition to the computer's built-in screen but only at certain locations. It is recommended that RandR or ATI's or nVidia's single GPU method be used in these cases. Xinerama's lack of support for adding or removing screens causes several problems:

* Windows may be drawn to a screen that is not connected to the computer. The user is required to drag these windows to the main screen but is unable to see them.
* Video signals sent to disconnected displays use unnecessary power and may reduce battery life.
* It becomes difficult to use a device in multiple locations where available external screens are likely to be configured differently.

These problems are related to Xinerama's implementation rather than its design and can be corrected with further development.

===Window manager support===
xmonad's xinerama support: tiling on three screens simultaneously.
Some window managers and desktop environments have limited awareness of the separate physical screens in Xinerama so that the desktop is simply stretched over the physical screens instead of arranged as a single large desktop. The window manager may place a new window on an unexpected screen which can be confusing and annoying. Xinerama nevertheless offers the advantage that windows can be moved between screens unlike in X.

===Dead space===
The physical displays do not need to be the same resolution and the virtual display area is not necessarily rectangular if the component physical displays are not the same size. Some window managers assume a rectangular display area and enforce this by creating excess ""dead space"" at the edges of a display. The window manager needs awareness of Xinerama to avoid placing new windows in this dead space.

168986,Kenneth More,Personal life,"More was married three times. His first marriage in 1940 to actress Mary Beryl Johnstone (one daughter Susan Jane born 1941) ended in divorce in 1946. He married Mabel Edith ""Bill"" Barkby in 1952 (one daughter Sarah born 1954) but left her in 1968 for Angela Douglas an actress 26 years his junior causing considerable estrangement from friends and family. He was married to Douglas (whom he nicknamed ""Shrimp"") from 17 March 1968 until his death.

More wrote two autobiographies ''Happy Go Lucky'' (1959) and ''More or Less'' (1978). In the second book he related how he had had since childhood a recurrent dream of something akin to a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war he experienced a Nazi Stuka dive-bomber descending in just such a manner. After that he claimed never to have had that dream again. Producer Daniel M. Angel successfully sued More for libel in 1980 over comments made in his second autobiography.

===Illness and Death===
More and Douglas separated for several years during the 1970s but reunited when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The disease made it increasingly difficult for him to work and his last job was in a US TV adaptation of ''A Tale of Two Cities''. In 1980 when he was being sued by producer Danny Angel for comments in his memoirs he told the court he was retired.

In 1981 he wrote that:
Doctors and friends ask me how I feel. How can you define ""bloody awful?"" My
nerves are stretched like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I have to have Angela's arm to support me most days... my balance or lack of it is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife who holds nothing of the past over my head is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I have a lot of time with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However my friends always associate me with the song: ""When You're Smiling..."" lt isn't always easy but I'm trying to live up to it.
More died of the disease on 12 July 1982 aged 67 and was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.

184380,Electro (music),Definition and characteristics,"

From its inception one of the defining characteristics of the electro sound was the use of drum machines particularly the Roland TR-808 as the rhythmic basis of the track. As the genre evolved  computers and sampling replaced drum machines in electronic music and are now used by the majority of electro producers. It is important to note that although the electro of the 1980s and contemporary electro (electronic dance music) both grew out of the dissolution of disco they are now different genres.

Classic (1980s) electro drum patterns tend to be electronic emulations of breakbeats (occasionally a four to the floor pattern is used as well) with a syncopated kick drum and usually a snare or clap accenting the backbeat. The difference between electro drumbeats and breakbeats (or breaks) is that electro tends to be more mechanical while breakbeats tend to have more of a human-like feel like that of a live drummer.  The definition however is somewhat ambiguous in nature due to the various uses of the term.

The Roland TR-808 drum machine hit the market in 1980 defining early electro with its immediately recognizable sound. Staccato percussive drumbeats tended to dominate electro almost exclusively provided by the TR-808. As an inexpensive way of producing a drum sound the TR-808 caught on quickly with the producers of early electro because of the ability of its bass drum to generate extreme low-frequencies. This aspect of the Roland TR-808 was especially appealing to producers who would test drive their tracks in nightclubs (like NYC's Funhouse) where the bass drum sound was essential for a record's success. Its unique percussion sounds like handclaps open and closed high-hat clave and cowbell became integral to the electro sound.  A number of popular songs in the early 1980s employed the TR-808 including Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing” Cybotron’s “Clear” and Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock.” The Roland TR-808 has attained iconic status eventually being used on more hits than any other drum machine. Through the use of samples the Roland TR-808 remains popular in electro and other genres to the present day.

Other electro instrumentation was generally electronic favoring analog synthesis programmed bass lines sequenced or arpeggiated synthetic riffs and atonal sound effects all created with synthesizers. Heavy use of effects such as reverbs delays chorus or phasers along with eerie synthetic ensemble strings or pad sounds emphasized the science fiction or futuristic themes of classic (1980s) electro represented in the lyrics and/or music. Electro hip hop group Warp 9's 1983 single Light Years Away produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher exemplifies the Sci-Fi afrofuturist aspect of electro reflected in both the lyrics and instrumentation. The imagery of its lyrical refrain ''space is the place for the human race'' pays homage to Sun Ra's 1974 film while its synth lines and sound effects are informed by sci-fi computer games and cartoons""born of a science-fiction revival."".


Most electro is instrumental but a common element is vocals processed through a vocoder. Additionally speech synthesis may be used to create robotic or mechanical lyrical content as in the iconic Planet Rock and the automatous chant in the chorus of Nunk by Warp 9. Although primarily instrumental early electro utilized rap. Male rap dominated the genre however female rappers are an integral part of the electro tradition whether featured in a group as in Warp 9 or as solo performers like Roxanne Shante. The lyrical style that emerged along with electro became less popular by the 1990s as rapping continued to evolve becoming the domain of hip hop music.

The church was gutted during the firebombing but remained standing and in its prominent position in the city was a stark reminder of what Liverpool and the surrounding area had endured. It eventually became a garden of remembrance to commemorate the thousands of local men women and children who died as a result of the bombing of their city and region. Other architectural casualties of the Blitz included the Custom House Bluecoat Chambers and Liverpool Museum. However many buildings were restored after the War while the Custom House was controversially demolished.

St Lukes church is affectionately known locally as The Bombed Out and is a popular local meeting point.

65988,Lodge Grass Montana,Source and derivation of name,"The two words of the name of ""Lodge Grass"" are not usually put together in that order to make a commonly used name or meaningful phrase.  This is because the name ""Lodge Grass"" came from a mistake of interpretation of the Crow Indian name for ""Greasy Grass"".

Lodge Grass is named after Lodge Grass Creek which flows through the town but as explained in a video viewed in 2013 on YouTube by Joe Medicine Crow Crow tribal historian the correct Crow name for Lodge Grass Creek is Greasy Grass Creek.

Crow tradition holds that when the Crows camped on the bottoms of Lodge Grass Creek or Little Bighorn River the grass in the valley would be high and in the morning when the dew was heavy the bellies and legs of the horses would become wet and glisten as if covered with grease. In another traditional version of the same derivation of the name when the Crows camped on the creek and walked through the thick grass in the morning when it held dew their moccasins and leggings would get wet and they would look greasy.  Thus the Crows called the creek ""the Greasy Grass"".

The Crow name for ""greasy"" and the Crow name for ""lodge"" sound very much alike.  The Crow word for ""greasy"" is ''Tah-shay'' and the Crow word for ""lodge"" is ''Ah-shay'' and the words sound so much alike that an early interpreter mistakenly interpreted the Crow name for ""Greasy Grass"" as ""Lodge Grass"".

The misinterpreted name stuck and so the creek and then the town became known as Lodge Grass.

387497,Maritime Mobile Service Identity,Station Identity Formats,"
===Ship station identities===
The 9-digit code constituting a ship station identity is formed as follows:

:'''MIDxxxxxx'''

where MID represent the Maritime Identification Digits and X is any figure from 0 to 9. If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat B C or M ship earth station or it is expected to be so equipped in the foreseeable future then the identity should have three trailing zeros:

:'''MIDxxx000'''

If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat C ship earth station or it is expected to be so equipped in the foreseeable future then the identity could have one trailing zero:

:'''MIDxxxxx0'''

If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat A ship earth station or has satellite equipment other than Inmarsat then the identity needs no trailing zero.

===Group ship station call identities===
Group ship station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one ship are formed as follows:

:'''0MIDxxxxx'''

where the first figure is zero and X is any figure from 0 to 9. The particular MID represents only the country assigning the group ship station call identity and so does not prevent group calls to fleets containing more than one ship nationality.


====Coast station identities====
Coast station identities are formed as follows:

:'''00MIDxxxx'''

where the first two figures are zeros and X is any figure from 0 to 9. The MID reflects the country in which the coast station or coast earth station is located.

====Group coast station call identities====
Group coast station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one coast station have the same format as individual coast station IDs: two leading zeros the MID and the four digits. They are formed as a subset of coast station identities as follows:

:'''00MID0000''' for any coast station using the MID
:'''009990000''' for any VHF coast station (regardless of MID)
US Coast Guard stations use a non-standard MMSI: 003669999 - any US Coast Guard Base station
Note that administrations in other countries may use different formats.

Reference: ITU-R Recommendations M.585-7

====Search and Rescue Transmitter====

AIS Search and Rescue Transmitters (AIS-SART) have an identifier related to the manufacturer rather than a country's MID:

:'''970YYxxxx'''

The digitals represented by the two Y characters are assigned by the International Association for Marine Electronics Companies and refer to the SART manufacturer while the Xs are sequential digits assigned by the manufacturer identifying the SART.

===Federal US MMSIs ===
In the United States (one of whose MIDs is 366) federal MMSIs are assigned by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and are normally (but not always) formed as 3669xxxxx. Non-federal MMSIs are assigned by the Federal Communications Commission normally as part of the ship station license application and are formed as 366xxx000 for ships on international voyages and ships needing an Inmarsat mobile earth station or 366xxxxx0 for all other ships.

The United States Coast Guard group ship station call identity is 036699999 and group coast station call identity is 003669999.

In the U.S. MMSIs are primarily used for digital selective calling and for assigning Inmarsat identities.

198031,Governor-General of the Philippines,High Commissioner to the Philippines (1935–42 and 1945–46),"
On November 15 1935 the Commonwealth of the Philippines was inaugurated as a transitional government to prepare the country for independence. The office of President of the Philippine Commonwealth replaced the Governor-General as the country's chief executive. The Governor-General became the High Commissioner of the Philippines with Frank Murphy the last governor-general as the first high commissioner.  The High Commissioner exercised no executive power but rather represented the colonial power the United States Government in the Philippines. The high commissioner moved from Malacañang Palace to the newly built High Commissioner's Residence now the Embassy of the United States in Manila.

After the Philippine independence on July 4 1946 the last High Commissioner Paul McNutt became the first United States Ambassador to the Philippines.

27697,Juliette Binoche,Early life,"Binoche was born in Paris the daughter of Jean-Marie Binoche a director actor and sculptor and Monique Yvette Stalens a teacher director and actress. Her father who is French also has one eighth Portuguese-Brazilian ancestry; he was raised partly in Morocco by his French-born parents. Juliette's mother was born in Częstochowa Poland. Binoche's maternal grandfather Andre Stalens was born in Poland of Belgian (Walloon) and French descent and Binoche's maternal grandmother Julia Helena Młynarczyk was of Polish origin. Both of them were actors who were born in Częstochowa; the German Nazi occupiers imprisoned them at Auschwitz as intellectuals.

When Binoche's parents divorced in 1968 four-year-old Binoche and her sister Marion were sent to a provincial boarding school. During their teens the Binoche sisters spent their school holidays with their maternal grandmother not seeing their parents for months at a time. Binoche has stated that this perceived parental abandonment had a profound effect on her.

She was not particularly academic and in her teenage years began acting at school in amateur stage-productions. At 17 she directed and starred in a student production of the Eugène Ionesco play ''Exit the King''. She studied acting at the ''Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique'' (CNSAD) but quit after a short time as she disliked the curriculum. In the early 1980s she found an agent through a friend and joined a theater troupe touring France Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym ""Juliette Adrienne"". Around this time she began lessons with acting coach Vera Gregh.

Her first professional screen experience came as an extra in the three-part TF1 television series ''Dorothée danseuse de corde'' (1983) directed by Jacques Fensten followed by a similarly small role in the provincial television film ''Fort bloque'' directed by Pierrick Guinnard. After this Binoche secured her first feature-film appearance with a minor role in Pascal Kané's ''Liberty Belle'' (1983). Her role required just two days on–set but was enough to inspire Binoche to pursue a career in film.

512213,Beedi,Introduction,"



Packs of beedies.

A '''beedi''' (; from ; also spelled '''bidi''' or '''biri''') is a thin cigarette or mini-cigar filled with tobacco flake and commonly wrapped in a ''Diospyros melonoxylon'' or ''Piliostigma racemosum'' leaf tied with a string or adhesive at one end. It originates from the Indian subcontinent. The name is derived from the Marwari word ''beeda''—a mixture of betel nuts herbs and spices wrapped in a leaf.

A traditional method of tobacco use throughout South Asia and parts of the Middle East today beedies are popular and inexpensive in India. There beedi consumption outpaces that of conventional cigarettes and these tobacco-filled leaves deliver more nicotine carbon monoxide and tar and carry a greater risk of oral cancers. Beedies accounted for 48% of Indian tobacco consumption in 2008. As with many other types of smoking beedis increase the risk of certain kinds of cancers heart disease and lung disease. They may also be more harmful than other forms of tobacco consumption.

618657,Panguna,Introduction,"NASA Landsat image of Panguna showing tailings runoff.

'''Panguna''' is a town and a (now decommissioned) copper mine on Bougainville Island Papua New Guinea. It was owned and operated by Bougainville Copper Ltd a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Beginning operations in 1972 the company hired thousands of workers most from other parts of the country. 

By the end of its operations on May 15 1989 when the mine was closed because of an armed uprising on the island it was the largest open-cut mine in the world. It was accused of contaminating large areas due to its toxic waste which affected land water and air. Resentment against the environmental poisoning and the fact that most profits left the island were major catalysts in the unrest in Bougainville in the 1970s and 1980s leading to the Bougainville Civil War which lasted from 1988 until 1998.

103496,Jacob Jordaens,Tapestry designs,"Jacob Jordaens. ''Kitchen Scene'' preparatory study for the tapestry ''Interior of a Kitchen''
Jacob Jordaens' most significant body of work were the numerous designs he did for tapestries. As the most lucrative of the arts tapestries were considered precious throughout the Renaissance and Baroque periods. These large wall hangings had begun to appear on the walls of wealthy European nobility in the fourteenth century. Following the success of the Brussels tapestries woven after the Raphael cartoons 16th and 17th-century patrons employed artists as tapestry designs; Jacob Jordaens Peter Paul Rubens and Pietro Cortona flattered patrons allegorically in a manner that would identify them with famous historical or mythological figures as a form of aristocratic self-promotion.  Jordaens found that he was particularly successful in the tapestry ventures.  He was especially motivated in this field and his perfected techniques and style earned him numerous commissions for series of tapestries.  He was seen as one of the leading tapestry designers of the era.

Jordaens’ process of tapestry creation included a preliminary drawing or sketch of the design.  The design then is transferred to larger more detailed oil sketch for the full-scale cartoon which the weavers work from directly in weaving tapestry.  Jordaens began planning a tapestry by executing a preparatory drawing coloured with water-soluble pigments.  Although Jordaens did some sketches in oil most were executed on paper or later in his career directly on canvas. Jordaens’ tapestries were made for the aristocracy who placed such high value on them they would carry them with them while they travelled or went on military campaigns as a symbol of their status. Jordaens’ scope of artistic representation was diverse ranging from mythology country life to the history of Charlemagne. It has been noted that Jordaens’ tapestry design incorporated densely organized crowds of figures packed into a flat two-dimensional picture plane emphasizing surface patterns which resulted in a ""woven picture"". Just as he liked to crowd his genre paintings he carried forward to his tapestries.

The drawing done for the tapestry ''Interior of a Kitchen'' is an example of a part of the process used by Jacob Jordaens. He has used brown ink and applied colour over black chalk on paper to layout the still life on a table and how the figures were to be arranged. The final tapestry underwent changes but the initial design which borrowed elements of still life paintings by the seventeenth century Antwerp artist Frans Snyders was fairly closely adhered to.

Tiltle page of ''Lapponia''
'''''Lapponia''''' is a book written by Johannes Schefferus (1621 - 1679) covering a very comprehensive history of Northern Scandinavia topology environment and Sami living condition dwelling-places clothing gender roles hunting child raising shamanism and pagan religion. It was published in late 1673 and closely followed by English German French and Dutch translations. Adapted and abridged version were also followed where only original chapters on shamanism and religion was preserved but the others replaced with tales on magic sorcery drums and heathenism.

The book uses ""Lap"" mainly to notice that Samis are still pagan and it is concluded that Lap is a word introduced by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1150 - 1220) to distinguish Sami peoples living near the ocean (coast-fenni) and in the woodland (lapp-fenni).

It was aimed to meet rumors or as the council Magnus De La Gardie saw as degrading propaganda from (particular German) pamphlets claiming the Swedes had used ""Sami magic"" on the European battlefields.

The book was not until 1956 (after 300 years) fully translated to Swedish (as ''Lappland'' Acta Lapponica 8 Uppsala 1956). Its references is however based on ""clergy correspondence"" letters i.e. reports made by priests.

A smaller part of the geographical region described in the book is today named Lappland (or Laponia.)

795147,No-go area,Alleged contemporary no-go areas,"The following are areas that have been described as no-go areas in recent years though in some cases the characterization has been disputed.

===Belgium===
In the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks the Molenbeek municipality in Brussels was described in many media reports as a ""no-go area"" where gang violence and Islamic fundamentalism had fed on Molenbeek’s marginalisation despair and festering resentment of authority. In 2015 Belgium’s home affairs minister said that the government did not “have control of the situation in Molenbeek"" and that terrorists' links to this district were a ""gigantic problem"".

===Brazil===
Some favelas in Brazil most notably in Rio de Janeiro are controlled by gangs with automatic weapons. Police and investigative reporters have been tortured and killed there such as Tim Lopes in 2002. Attempts at clearing up such areas have led to security crises in Rio as well as in São Paulo.

===France===
An early usage of the term regarding Europe was in a 2002 opinion piece by David Ignatius in ''The New York Times'' where he wrote about France ""Arab gangs regularly vandalize synagogues here the North African suburbs have become no-go zones at night and the French continue to shrug their shoulders."" La Courneuve a municipality (commune) in the Paris region was described by police as a no-go zone.

In 2010 Raphaël Stainville of French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' called certain neighborhoods of the southern city Perpignan ""veritable lawless zones"" saying they had become too dangerous to travel in at night. He added that the same was true in parts of Béziers and Nîmes. In 2012  the mayor of the French city Amiens in the wake of several riots called the northern part of his city a lawless zone where one could no longer order a pizza or call for a doctor. In 2014 Fabrice Balanche a scholar of the Middle East labelled the northern city of Roubaix as well as parts of Marseille ""mini-Islamic states"" saying that the authority of the state is completely absent there. American magazines ''Newsweek'' and ''The New Republic'' have also used the term to describe parts of France.

In January 2015 after the ''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting in Paris various American media including the news cable channels Fox News and CNN described the existence of no-go zones across Europe and in France in particular or featured guests that referred to them. In some cases the French areas termed ""sensitive urban zones"" were described as no-go zones. Both networks were criticized for these statements and anchors on both networks later apologized for the characterizations. The mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo said that she intended to sue Fox News for its statements.

===Germany===
A sociology paper published in 2009 said that right-wing extremists had been discussing the creation of no-go areas in Western Europe since the 1980s. It described attempts to create ""national liberated zones"" (''national befreite Zonen'') in Germany: ""'no-go-areas' which are areas dominated by neo-Nazis"" attributing their appeal in the former DDR to ""the unmet promises of modernisation and the poor socio-cultural conditions that offer no perspectives to young people"". Whether or not Germany actually had no-go zones was disputed: the paper concluded ""according to ... state officials the police and other relevant institutions the phenomenon of no-go zones does not actually exist ... by contrast the national press in Germany various civic associations and also experts acknowledge and give examples of the existence of no-go areas.""

In a 2011 interview  then president of the German police union Gewerkschaft der Polizei stated that some areas in Germany mostly with a high immigrant population had become no-go areas where police feared to enter.

=== Malaysia ===
The Gaya Island is a location of an illegal Filipino colony called ''Kampung Lok Urai'' with stilt houses girdling the beach. Both the Malaysian federal government and the Sabah state government do not officially recognise the settlement and the inhabitants as the inhabitants are known as illegal immigrants. It has a 6000 floating population of largely Filipinos Suluk and Bajau. It is considered a dangerous high crime or ""no-go"" area by the police and the locals.

===Sweden===
The Swedish government states that ""no-go zones"" do not exist in Sweden.

A 2016 report from the Swedish Police map 53 so called ""exposed"" areas (Utsatta områden) of which 15 were ""particularly exposed"". An ""exposed area"" is an area with low socioeconomic status and the area is affected by criminality. A ""particularly exposed"" area is defined by an unwillingness to participate in legal proceedings difficulties for the police to carry out their mission parallel social structures violent extremism and finally proximity to other exposed areas. These definitions are used to adapt their procedures when working in these areas for example bringing certain equipment and working in pairs when in a ""particularly exposed area"".

In March 2015 journalist Henrik Höjer discussed the rise of criminality especially organized crime in various neighborhoods within Sweden since the mid-1990s especially in the city of Malmö. He interviewed a police officer and task force chief who referred to such areas as ""no go areas"" and wrote that gangs like to lay claim to an area by throwing stones at mailmen police firefighters and ambulances who enter the area.

In February 2016 a news crew for ''Australia's 60 Minutes'' working with anti-immigration activist Jan Sjunnesson reported having come under attack including having stones thrown on them and a car running over the foot of a cameraman who was trying to prevent it from leaving in the immigrant-dominated district of Rinkeby of Stockholm. ''60 Minutes'' published the video on which reporter Liz Hayes states ""there are now 55 declared no-go zones in Sweden.""

A 10-minute December 2016 film by FoxNews.com's Ami Horowitz ''Stockholm Syndrome'' focused on violence by Muslim immigrants within Sweden and included an interview with two policemen who seemed to confirm that there are no-go areas for police in Sweden. During the interview one officer states ""If the police is chasing another car for some kind of crime if they reach what we call 'no-go areas' the police won't go after it."" The police officers later objected to the interview and said that their quotes had been taken out of context and a videographer who worked on the film supported the officers' account saying the video was cut together unethically. The documentary gained significant attention several months later when U.S. President Donald Trump indirectly alluded to it in a speech. The film as a whole and its description of no-go areas have both been disputed by sources within Sweden; the Swedish ''The Local'' quoted a police spokesperson as saying that though there are areas ""characterized by among other things the difficulty for the police to fulfill its duty"" ""There are no guidelines that the police should not visit these areas"". The description of no-go zones was also disputed by Felipe Estrada Dörner a criminology professor at Stockholm University.

In a 2017 interview with the ''Weekly Standard'''s  Gordon Grattidge described as the head of the Swedish ambulance drivers' union stated that there were areas where it is too dangerous for rescue workers to enter without police protection using the English term ""no-go zones"" to describe them.

===United Kingdom===
In 2012 Professor Hamid Ghodse of the United Nations' International Narcotics Control Board included areas of Birmingham Manchester and Liverpool as ""no-go areas"" run by drug traffickers comparing them to Brazilian favelas. Local police forces denied the claims.

An intense focused and intelligent man Charleston was among the most renowned players of his time a tremendous power and contact hitter and one of the finest defensive center fielders of all-time. His career batting average was .348 and he regularly finished among league leaders in both home runs and stolen bases. He was also known for his combative nature getting into many brawls including at least one memorable fight with an array of Cuban soldiers.

In 1932 Charleston became player-manager of the Pittsburgh Crawfords and presided over what some baseball historians consider the best Negro league team ever. His roster included Hall of Famers Josh Gibson Satchel Paige and Judy Johnson. The team went 99-36 and Charleston himself batted .363.

In addition to his tremendous play in the Negro leagues Charleston excelled in exhibition play against all-white major league teams batting .318 with 11 home runs in 53 games. Contemporary observers compared his play to that of Tris Speaker and Babe Ruth. Some baseball historians consider him one of the greatest players in history. He died at age 57 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

Most of the major thoroughfares run on a cartographic grid: notable streets include Sepulveda Boulevard Ventura Boulevard Laurel Canyon Boulevard San Fernando Road Victory Boulevard Reseda Boulevard Riverside Drive Mulholland Drive and State Route 27 – Topanga Canyon Boulevard.

===Rapid transit===
Subway dedicated transitway and express and local buses provided by many agencies serve the San Fernando Valley. Some of the former rights-of-way of the Pacific Electric Railway which first accelerated population growth in the Valley have been repurposed for busways and light rail lines.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates two Metro Red Line subway stations in the Valley which are located at Universal City and North Hollywood which connect it directly to Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. With transfers they connect the Valley to the entire Metro regional light rail and subway network. Connections are available to Mid-Wilshire San Gabriel Valley LAX adjacent and Long Beach termini. The Red Line's two Valley subway stations provide access to national travel through Bob Hope Airport and Amtrak and regional travel through Metrolink Metro Rapid Metro Local and the Metro Orange Line.

The Orange Line busway uses a dedicated transitway route running the east-west length of the Valley connecting the North Hollywood  Red Line Station to the Warner Center Transit Hub in Woodland Hills and then heads north through Canoga Park to the Chatsworth Metrolink train station.

===Rail and air===
Metrolink commuter rail has two Valley lines the Antelope Valley Line and Ventura County Line which connect the Valley and beyond to downtown Los Angeles and south becoming one line at the Burbank station.

Amtrak's ''Pacific Surfliner'' long-distance rail line has stops at Burbank Airport station Van Nuys and Chatsworth Station before proceeding on to Ventura County Santa Barbara and Northern California or Union Station and San Diego.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority is planning two stations in the Valley one in downtown Burbank and the other in Sylmar with an initial section of the railroad possibly opening in 2029.

The Valley's two major airports are Bob Hope Airport and the Van Nuys Airport. The Van Nuys – Airport FlyAway Terminal provides non-stop scheduled shuttle service to LAX and back to the Valley with parking.

646534,TigerDirect,Controversies,"
===Federal Trade Commission ruling===
On November 4 1999 case C3903 the Federal Trade Commission issued a decision and order against TigerDirect for violations of the Pre-sale Availability Rule the Disclosure Rule and the Warranty Act. Without admitting any wrongdoing TigerDirect agreed to ""not represent that it provides On-Site Service unless all limitations and conditions that apply are disclosed"" ""fulfill obligations under the warranty within a reasonable period of time after receiving notice from the consumer"" and ""cease and desist from failing to make warranty text available for examination prior to sale failing to disclose what is not covered under any given warranty or the procedures needed to have warranty work accomplished and failing to disclose that certain states may give the consumer legal rights in addition to those provided by the warranty.""

===Apple Computer lawsuit===
In early 2005 the company filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) alleging trademark infringement dilution and false designation of origin with Apple's introduction of Mac OS X v10.4 marketed with its codename ""Tiger"".  Although TigerDirect had registered several tiger-related names with the United States Patent and Trademark Office Apple received trademark approval for version 10.4 (Tiger) of its OS X operating system in 2003. TigerDirect registered opposition against Apple's filing with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and on May 13 2005 Apple won an emergency hearing. The judge ruled in favor of Apple considering the marks to be distinct.

===Infoworld report===
''Infoworld's'' Robert X. Cringely reported in 2006 that ""Tiger's sister company OnRebate.com which handles payouts for the discount dealer appears to specialize in the 'insufficient documentation' gambit""
Consumer-reported difficulties obtaining the rebates led to an investigation by the Florida Attorney General and a failure to maintain a satisfactory BBB rating. According to a former controller at TigerDirect improperly unpaid rebates were intentional: ""...the concept was that if the customer complains you send them out the check to make them happy.  But if they don't complain they totally forget about it. That is the concept of these rebates.  People forget that they sent them out.""

===Dell lawsuit===
On April 17 2009 Dell Inc. filed a lawsuit against TigerDirect. Dell alleged that TigerDirect a former authorized reseller of Dell products sold discontinued and outdated Dell products as new and under a Dell warranty. Dell also alleged that the products were from a third-party and advertised with an unauthorized modified version of the Dell logo. Dell became aware of this when TigerDirect customers contacted Dell to demand price matches.

===State of Florida lawsuit===
On September 4 2009 Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum filed suit against TigerDirect OnRebate and their parent company Systemax charging the companies with failing to provide rebates to customers. Systemax responded that a separate class action lawsuit making similar allegations had been filed in federal court in 2007 and was dismissed on August 31 2009.  The company denied the allegations in the Florida Attorney General complaint; the suit was eventually settled for $300000.

===CBC investigation ===
In the 42nd season of ''Marketplace'' a Canadian consumer advocacy newsmagazine show on CBC Television TigerDirect was featured in the episode ""Online reviews: When companies edit your review"". The show featured a consumer who had purchased several computers from the retailer and subsequently gave a poor review for service. The review was edited by TigerDirect prior to the review being placed on the firm's website. The consumer contacted TigerDirect several times to have the edited review removed but failed until Marketplace contacted TigerDirect on his behalf.

===Founders convicted of fraud===
In 2014 brothers Carl and Gilbert Fiorentino were arrested and charged in federal court with scheming to obtain $9 million in kickbacks and other benefits and to hide their ill-gotten gains from the Internal Revenue Service while working as senior executives at Systemax Inc. and its TigerDirect Inc. unit. The government alleged the brothers schemed to obtain kickbacks for steering company business to certain contractors between 2002 and 2011. In one case the brothers received more than $9 million in cash and other payments for steering more than $230 million in business to an Asian supplier of computer parts and accessories. In 2015 Gilbert Fiorentino pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge while Carl Fiorentino pleaded guilty to both fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. Carl Fiorentino had faced significantly more time than Gilbert Fiorentino but U.S. District Judge Jose E. Martinez decided to sentence them to similar prison terms. Gilbert received 5 years in prison while Carl received 6-1/2 years.  In March of 2016 the Fiorentino brothers were ordered to pay a total of $35 million in restitution to Systemax.

He is the first-born son of José Roberto Andrade and Gloria Esther (Mendez) Andrade.  His father was serving in the United States Air Force at the time of Dino’s birth.  The family immediately relocated to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey where Dino spent the first five years of his life before his father left the armed services and the family returned to California.  Andrade has one sister Sabrina born six years later to the day on September 16 1969.  Dino admits that his love of all things science fiction horror and fantasy is lifelong and in his blood. He has even been quoted saying ""I was that guy in acting class that while everyone was reading Mamet and O'Neill I was reading Batman comics"" thus attributing his love of animation and graphic storytelling to making his career in voice acting the natural choice for him.

382813,Le Droit,History,"
The newspaper was launched at that period as a tool to condemn Regulation 17 an Ontario legislation that restricted education in French at that time. Today it defends federalism in Canada as well as provincial jurisdictions. It is still involved in the protection of francophone rights in Ontario notably advocating for the survival of the Montfort Hospital during the government of Ontario premier Mike Harris.

In the 1960s ''Le Droit'' tried to extend its market into Northeastern Ontario including the North Bay Timmins and Sudbury areas but quickly abandoned the project due to high costs. Originally published as a broadsheet it switched to tabloid format in 1988 following an 11-week strike by the pressmen. The newspaper also had a previous strike in 1982.

In 2001 Gesca a subsidiary of Power Corporation owned by Franco-Ontarian Paul Desmarais acquired the paper from Conrad Black's Hollinger who owned it between 1987 and 2001. In the eighties it belonged to Montreal-based Jacques Francoeur the founder of Sunday weekly ''Dimanche-Matin'' who built the Unimedia chain which included ''Le Soleil'' (Quebec City) and ''Le Quotidien'' (Chicoutimi now Saguenay). He acquired ''Le Droit'' from the Oblates.

The publisher is Jacques Pronovost since 2007. Before him it was led by Claude Gagnon (2002–2007) Pierre Bergeron (1993–2002) Gilbert Lacasse (1987–1993) and Jean-Robert Bélanger (1953?-1987).

249411,Lola Cars,Formula One,"Lola Mk.4 the first Lola Formula 1 at 1962 Dutch GP driven by Surtees
1967 Lola T130 'Hondola'
Lola resisted making a 'works' Formula One entry for many years being content to construct cars on behalf of other entrants. Lola's first works entry in 1997 led directly to the financial ruin of the company.

===Bowmaker and Parnell===
Lola made its first foray into Formula One in 1962 supplying Lola Mk4 cars to Reg Parnell's ''Bowmaker-Yeoman Racing Team'' with John Surtees and Roy Salvadori as drivers. A measure of success was immediate with Surtees's car claiming pole position in its first World Championship race but although points were often scored wins in Championship Grands Prix eluded the team. After Bowmaker's withdrawal Parnell continued to run the cars privately. Privateer Bob Anderson gave the Mk4 its last victory in the non-Championship 1963 Rome Grand Prix. Consistency however was not to be found and after only two seasons Lola abandoned Formula One cars for the time being.

===""Hondola"" Honda RA300 and RA301===
In 1967 Lola assisted Honda Racing and John Surtees with the design of their F1 car. The overweight chassis design by the engine-specialists from Honda was abandoned and a 1966 Lola Indianapolis monocoque (Lola T90) used as the basis for a Honda-engined car. The resultant Honda RA300 was called the ""Lola T130"" by Lola Cars unofficially called the ""Hondola"" by the press and was sufficiently light and powerful to win the 1967 Italian Grand Prix.

===BMW Formula Two cars===
A number of Lola-built BMW F2 cars were subsequently entered in the F2 class of the German Grand Prix at about this time.

===Embassy Hill===

Towards the end of his long career Graham Hill found it difficult to attract works drives; with a view to both finding a drive and a future as a team owner he established his own team backed by the Embassy cigarette brand. After an unsuccessful 1973 with a customer Shadow the team commissioned its own cars from Lola. The T370 was largely based on the Formula 5000 cars of the time and looked similar to Lola's F5000 cars although it sported a larger airbox. The car was developed by Andy Smallman into the Hill GH1 in 1975 but the team's first in-house design the Hill GH2 remained unraced when Hill Tony Brise Smallman and several other team personnel were killed in an air crash in November 1975.

===Haas Lola===

The Haas Lola F1 programme was extremely promising funded by a large American industrial conglomerate Beatrice Foods and run by the highly experienced Teddy Mayer with the promise of works Ford power but it flattered to deceive. The handsome car designed mostly by Neil Oatley was barely a Lola; the name was used largely because Haas was Lola's US concessionaire although Broadley had some involvement with the car. Alan Jones was tempted out of retirement to drive it in F1 races towards the end of the 1985 season with Patrick Tambay joining in a second car for 1986. A works Ford-Cosworth turbocharged engine was promised but this did not materialise until 1986 and old Hart four-cylinder units were used. Car engine drivers and sponsors were all troublesome and the team folded after the 1986 season with most of its assets (including the factory) being sold to Bernie Ecclestone. At one point during the season Ecclestone informed the Haas Lola team that ""his driver"" (Patrese) would be in the car at the next meeting; Ecclestone was primarily interested in acquiring the Ford engines as a replacement for the BMW units in his Brabhams but the manufacturer vetoed this offering the engines to Benetton instead. He used the team's factory to build the ill-fated Alfa Romeo ""ProCar"" (a series for ""silhouette"" touring cars with F1-style mechanicals and engines).

===Larrousse & Calmels===


The Larrousse & Calmels programme was initially much lower-key than the previous effort. Starting from a simple Cosworth-powered car based on Lola's F3000 technologies the French team built up a steady reputation in normally aspirated F1 from 1987 on. They attracted Lamborghini V12 power for 1989 and once the Chris Murphy-designed car was on stream scored some good results with Éric Bernard and Aguri Suzuki. The team experienced some problems after Didier Calmels's arrest for the murder of his wife but continued at a slightly lower key with Cosworth power again. Unfortunately due to irregularities with the team's F1 entry in 1990 (the cars were entered as Larrousses but were really Lolas) they lost all their Constructors' Championship points – which promoted the politically well-connected Ligier outfit into a position in the Constructors' Championship that gave them significant FIA benefits.

===Scuderia Italia===

The Scuderia Italia programme was something of a disaster from the start. The team had done reasonably well with Dallara chassis before but turned to Lola for 1993. Powered by customer Ferrari engines both engine and car seemed to be well off the pace and Michele Alboreto and Luca Badoer struggled to even qualify for races. Badoer finished 7th in the 1993 San Marino Grand Prix a race of high attrition to score the best Lola result of the season. The team withdrew from F1 before the end of the season and partly merged with Minardi for 1994.

===Unraced test cars===
Lola built a number of Cosworth V8 powered test cars in 1994–95 with rumours of a Havoline-funded quasi-works Ford team. The rumour was that Cosworth V12s badged Jaguar would go to Benetton in fact no Ford/Jaguar V12 ran in F1 or elsewhere and Lola would inherit the Zetec V8.
Allan McNish did much of the test driving but as this was a period of instability in the F1 rules little was achieved.

===MasterCard-sponsored works programme===

Lola had originally intended to enter Formula One in their own right in 1998 but pressure from main sponsor MasterCard caused Lola to debut its new car one year early in 1997. The sponsorship model was curious linked both to MasterCard membership of a 'club' and to results – something a first-year F1 team often finds hard to achieve. A custom-built V10 engine from Al Melling was going to be fitted to the cars which initially started racing fitted with underpowered Ford Cosworth ED V8s.

The cars had a lot of problems the worst being aerodynamics – they had never even been tested in a wind-tunnel when they arrived in Australia which by that point in time was unthinkable. The car was fundamentally flawed and the lack of wind-tunnel time had made it even less competitive. Despite the car's problems the team was confident that it could finish ahead of some of the other teams. The results were disastrous the cars were well off the pace and were no faster than Lola's Formula 3000 cars. After only one race the sponsors pulled out; the team turned up for the second race in Brazil but the cars did not turn a wheel and that was the end of the MasterCard Lola story. Shortly afterwards the entire Lola Car Company went into receivership. The company was saved through the purchase and cash rescue package from Martin Birrane.

===Planned 2010 F1 project===
On 22 April 2009 Lola announced on its website that ""Lola Group has commenced a major project comprising a full technical operational and financial evaluation aimed at developing a car to compete in the FIA Formula One World Championship"".

Lola was one of several teams to lodge an entry with the FIA for the 2010 Formula One World Championship.
On 17 June however the company abandoned its plans to return to F1 after failing to secure a place on the initial 2010 entry list.

88915,Peer pressure,Neural mechanisms,"From a purely neurological perspective the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the striatum play an important role in figuring out the value of specific actions. The mPFC is active when determining ""socially tagged"" objects which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these ""socially tagged"" objects and rewards in general. An experiment performed by Mason et al. utilizing fMRI scans analyzed individuals who were assigned to indicate if a chosen symbol appeared consecutively. The researchers did not tell the subjects the real purpose of the experiment which was to collect data regarding mPFC and striatum stimulation. Before the actual experiment began the subjects were subject to a phase of ""social"" influence where they learned which symbols were preferred by other subjects of completed the experiment (while in actuality these other subjects did not exist). Mason et al. found that determining an object's social value/significance is dependent on combined information from the mPFC and the striatum along the lines denoted in the beginning of the paragraph. Without both present and functional it would be difficult to determine the value of action based upon social circumstances.

A similar experiment was conducted by Stallen Smidts and Sanfrey. Twenty-four subjects were manipulated using a minimal group paradigm approach. Unbeknownst to them they were all selected as part of the ""in-group"" although there was an established ""out-group"". Following this socialization the subjects estimated the number of dots seen on the screen while given information about what an in-group or out-group member chose. Participants were more likely to conform to in-group decisions as compared to out-group ones. The experiment confirmed the importance of the striatum in social influence suggesting that conformity with the in-group is mediated with a fundamental value signal—rewards. In other wards the brain associates social inclusion with positive reward. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) which is associated with perspective taking appeared to be active as well which correlated with patients' self-reports of in-group trustworthiness.

In adolescence risk-taking appears to increase dramatically. Researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger (a peer of the same age) was in the car. A driving simulation was created and certain risky scenarios such as a decaying yellow light as the car was approaching were modeled and presented to the subjects. Those who were most likely to take risks in the presence of peers (but took fewer risks when there were no passengers) had greater brain activity in the social-cognitive and social-affective brain systems during solo activity (no passengers.) The social-cognitive aspect refers to the ability to gauge what others are thinking and is primarily controlled by the mPFC right temporal parietal junction and the posterior cingulate cortex. The social-affective aspect relates to the reward system for committing actions that are accepted or rejected by other people. One side of the reward system is ""social pain"" which refers to the emotional pain felt by individual due to group repudiation and is associated with heightened activity in the anterior insula and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex.

'''''Vendetta''''' is a 1950 American crime film based on the 1840 novella ''Colomba'' by Prosper Mérimée about a young Corsican girl who pushes her brother to kill to avenge their father's murder.

The film produced by Howard Hughes as a vehicle for his latest discovery Faith Domergue (pronounced ""Dah-mure"") began principal photography for United Artists in 1946 but was not released until four years later through RKO Pictures which Hughes had recently purchased. Hughes fired director Max Ophüls as well as his producing partner Preston Sturges who replaced Ophüls. Stuart Heisler completed the film but Hughes decided he wanted more changes and brought in actor/director Mel Ferrer who is the only credited director on the film.  Hughes himself did some direction of pick-up scenes.  The screenplay was credited to W. R. Burnett but the script was worked on by a number of writers including Sturges who originated the project at Hughes's behest.

''Vendetta'' is estimated to have cost around $4 million an extraordinary amount for the time.  The film was neither a critical nor a box office success.

210320,Stawell Victoria,History,"William McLachlan discovered alluvial gold at Pleasant Creek in May 1853 but the yield was not in sufficient volumes to attract much interest as the Ballarat and Bendigo fields were known to be giving better results and had already established the infrastructure to support the miners. There was however sufficient numbers for the area to support the beginnings of a settlement. The town site was first settled during 1853 and was named Pleasant Creek. The mining population of the Stawell field remained relatively small (averaging 200 or less) until 1857 when a series of new alluvial gold discoveries were made.

In August 1857 more extensive prospecting and mining occurred at what became known as Commercial Street Pleasant Creek.

Two Post Offices were opened Pleasant Creek on 19 October 1857 and Quartz Reef Pleasant Creek on 1 June 1859. In 1858 diggers opened the Great Western goldfield which was worked by some 9000 prospecters. The prospecting spread to nearby Deep Lead about 6 kilometres to northwest and it was reported that at the height of the rush there were over 25000 people in the area. At the same time shafts were being sunk around Big Hill becoming known as the Quartz Reefs. Much alluvial gold was found in the area but the 'fossicking' petered out by 1859.

In 1861 the township was renamed to honour Sir William Stawell (1815–89) the Chief Justice of Victoria resulting in the name of the Pleasant Creek post office becoming ""Stawell"". The town was created a borough in 1869.

In 1870 Stawell post office was renamed Stawell West and Quartz Reef Stawell post office was renamed to Stawell. Stawell Town Hall was constructed in 1872 under the guidance of Stawell Shire Engineer John D'Alton.

The former Free Library and Mechanics Institute building at 170 Main Street was constructed in 1874 to the design of Stawell architect George Inskip. The building has served as the location of the Mechanics Institute School of Design (later School of Mines) and the Borough Library. It is now the headquarters of Australian Regional Education.

The town's water supply system was designed by John D'Alton in 1875 diverting water from Fyan's Creek by tunnels and pipelines construction was completed in 1881.

By the mid-1920s the gold mining had effectively ceased as the yields were found to be no longer commercial viable. A Pioneer's memorial was erected on Big Hill in 1938.

The town hall underwent significant postwar remodelling culminating in the addition of the landmark clock tower in 1939.

The Quartz Gold Memorial and Dane Memorial seat were erected on Big Hill in 1953 out of local quartz stone.

Stawell's historical association with gold-mining was revived when full-scale mining recommenced in 1981.

149909,Obsidian use in Mesoamerica,Use,"
===Utilitarian===
Obsidian called ''itztli'' in the Nahuatl language has been found at nearly every Mesoamerican archaeological site.  Items made from this material had both utilitarian and ritual use.  In many areas it was available to all households regardless of socio-economic status and was used in hunting agriculture food preparation and for many other daily activities.  Morphologically obsidian was worked into a variety of tool forms including knives lance and projectile points prismatic blades general bifacial tools and utilized flakes. Blades have been found ''in situ'' with rabbit rodent and mollusk remains indicating their use in butchery. The practical use of obsidian is obvious considering that the material can be used to make some of the sharpest edges on earth.

===Ideological===
Obsidian was also used in a variety of non-utilitarian contexts.  Objects made of obsidian were used as associated grave goods employed in sacrifice (in whatever form) and in art.  Some non-utilitarian forms include miniature human effigies ear spools and labrets with gold and turquoise workings carved animal figurines beads vases and as pieces of masks.

Obsidian was frequently used in ritualized autosacrifice (blood-letting) activities serving as a substitute for stingray spines.  Its association with that act of bloodletting is important as it is argued by some researchers that obsidian was seen as a type of blood originating from the earth – its use in autosacrifice is therefore especially symbolic.  Objects made of obsidian were often buried in upper class tombs as special deposits or caches.  Obsidian debitage is found in many of these tombs in addition to evidence of its use in temple dedications potlaching or offerings. For example flakes have been found in association with stelae offerings and related to specific gods at the Maya site of Tikal. Its ritualized use is not however restricted to high-status political and religious contexts and it was clearly used within mundane domestic and household rituals.

310360,Speedcubing,History,"The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1980 which soon developed into a global craze. On June 5 1982 the first world championship was held in Budapest Hungary. 19 people competed in the event and the American Minh Thai won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community. The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983 but with the advent of the Internet sites relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time these sites brought in a new generation of cubers created a growing international online community and raised the profile of the art. People prominent in this online community such as Ron van Bruchem Tyson Mao Chris Hardwick and Ton Dennenbroek eventually wanted to meet in person and compete so twenty years after the first world championship they orchestrated a second one in Toronto in 2003 and another smaller competition in the Netherlands later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events which include regular national and international competitions. There were twelve competitions in 2004 58 more from 2005 to 2006 over 100 in 2008 and over 450 in 2014 with more happening every year. There have been seven more World Championships since Budapest's 1982 competition which are traditionally held every other year with the most recent in São Paulo Brazil in 2015. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the World Cube Association (WCA) founded by Ron van Bruchem and Tyson Mao.

430139,Rajshahi College,History,"Hazi Mohammad Mohsin Bhaban Est 1888
The origins of the college were in a private English School that had been founded in Rajshahi in 1828 by the concerted efforts of many of the region's most prominent citizens (this school is now known as Rajshahi Collegiate School). In 1836 the school was taken over by the provincial government of Bengal and was converted into a Government Zilla (or District) School. In 1873 again through the concerted efforts and appeals of local citizens the Zilla School was given the status of an Intermediate College and F.A. courses were introduced into its curriculum. With further development this college was accorded ""first-grade rank"" in 1878 which meant that it could teach B.A. courses and be affiliated to the University of Calcutta. The name ""Rajshahi College"" came with the first-grade rank in 1878. The year 1881 saw the inauguration of the M. A. classes; B.L. classes were added in 1883. The postgraduate Departments in Arts and in Law continued till 1909 when they were withdrawn because the college could not meet the requirements of the New Regulations of the University of Calcutta which came into force in that year.

Starting with only 6 students on the roll in 1873 the college counted 100 in 1878 200 in 1900 400 in 1910 800 in 1920 and no less than 1000 in 1924; there was only one Muslim student at the college in 1873; 5 years later it was still one but the figure rose to 156 in 1916 and climaxed at 215 in 1924. Subsequently of course Muslim numbers rose in the college and after 1947 eventually exceeded the Hindu numbers. Today in independent Bangladesh the college has been accorded ""University College"" status and no longer teaches Higher Secondary or Intermediate courses. Currently it is part of the National University system of Bangladesh and its curriculum includes only undergraduate and post-graduate courses in a variety of disciplines.

652051,Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology,History,"
=== Early history ===
Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah the first President of the Republic of Ghana
The Kumasi College of Technology opened officially on 22 January 1952 with 200 teacher training students transferred from Achimota to form the nucleus of the new college. In October 1952 the School of Engineering and the Department of Commerce were established and the first students were admitted. A Pharmacy Department was established in January 1953 with the transfer of the former School of Pharmacy from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital Accra to the college. The department ran a two-year comprehensive course in Pharmacy leading to the award of the Pharmacy Board Certificate. A Department of Agriculture was opened in the same year to provide ad hoc courses of varying duration from a few terms to three years for the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of General Studies was instituted to prepare students for the Higher School Certificate Examinations in Science and Arts subjects and to give instruction in subjects as requested by the other departments.

From 1952 to 1955 the School of Engineering prepared students for professional qualifications only. In 1955 the school embarked on courses leading to the University of London Bachelor of Engineering External Degree Examinations.

In 1957 the School of Architecture Town Planning and Building was inaugurated. Its first students were admitted in January 1958 for professional courses. As the college expanded it was decided to make the Kumasi College of Technology a purely science and technology institution. In pursuit of this policy the Teacher Training College with the exception of the Art School was transferred in January 1958 to the Winneba Training College; in 1959 the Commerce Department was transferred to Achimota to form the nucleus of the present School of Administration of the University of Ghana Legon.

In December 1960 the Government of Ghana appointed a University Commission to advise it on the development of university education in connection with the proposal to transform the University College of Ghana and the Kumasi College of Technology into an independent University of Ghana. Following the report of the commission which came out early 1961 the government decided to establish two independent universities in Kumasi and Legon Accra. The Kumasi College of Technology was thus transformed under the supervision of R. P. Baffour into a full-fledged University Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology by an Act of Parliament on 22 August 1961. The name honors Kwame Nkrumah the first prime minister and later president of Ghana.

The name was changed to University of Science and Technology after the Revolution of 24 February 1966. The University of Science and Technology was officially inaugurated on Wednesday 20 November 1961. However another act of Parliament (Act 559 of 1998) changed the name back to its original version the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Kumasi.

44485,Pinner,History,"Pinner Village was originally a hamlet first recorded in 1231 as ''Pinnora'' although the already archaic ''-ora'' (meaning 'hill') suggests its origins lie no later than ''c.''900. The name ''Pinn'' is shared with the River Pinn which runs through the village.

The oldest part of the village lies around the fourteenth-century parish church of St. John the Baptist at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens The High Street and Church Lane. The earliest surviving private dwelling East End Farm Cottage dates from the late fifteenth-century.

The village expanded rapidly between 1923 and 1939 when a series of garden estates including the architecturally significant Pinnerwood estate conservation area – encouraged by the Metropolitan Railway – grew around its historic core. It was largely from this time onwards that the area (including Hatch End which forms the northeastern part of Pinner) assumed much of its present-day suburban character. The area is now continuous with neighbouring suburban districts including Rayners Lane and Eastcote.

Pinner contains a large number of homes built in the 1930s Art Deco style the most grand of which is the Grade II listed Elm Park Court at the junction of West End Lane and Elm Park Road. Pinner has had an annual street fair held in May since 1336 when it was granted by Royal Charter by Edward III; it remains popular today.

427883,Quebec Boundaries Extension Act 1912,Introduction,"Province of Quebec

The '''Quebec Boundaries Extension Act 1912''' is an act passed by the Parliament of Canada on April 1 1912 that expanded the territory of the Province of Quebec. It was supplemental to the Quebec Boundary Extension Act 1898 that granted the province its first territorial enlargement. The act transferred to the province the vast territory bounded by the Eastmain River the Labrador coast and Hudson and Ungava Bays extending the northern boundary to its present location. These lands were inhabited by the aboriginal Cree Montagnais Naskapi and Inuit. 

Canada and Newfoundland disagreed on the location of the frontier between Quebec and Labrador until 1927: see Labrador Boundary Dispute.

147244,Chobham Common,Erosion mitigation,"The first car parks on Chobham Common were created in 1936 at Staple Hill and south of the Monument. After the Second World War the recreational use of the Common grew dramatically. This recreational use developed in an ad-hoc manner with walkers and horse riders creating tracks then abandoning them for new routes as they gullied and became impassable causing wide scale erosion of the site.

It is also reported that during the 1950s and 1960s visitors regularly took vehicles onto Chobham Common further adding to the problem. An aerial photograph dated 1964 clearly shows severe erosion problems on Tank Hill and Staple Hill. By the time Surrey County Council acquired Chobham Common in 1968 there were nine car parks on the area covered by this plan. Initially the Council wished to develop a country park but these plans were soon dropped in favour of informal recreation and nature conservation.

Erosion and disturbance continued to be serious problems through the 1970s and 1980s. While attempts to restrict horse riding proved unsuccessful by the late 1980s both walkers and riders were showing a marked preference for the growing network of high quality fire tracks.

In 1992 a consultative process began to resolve long running conflicts of interest between horse riders and other users and to rationalise the rights of way networks in order to meet the needs of visitors while protecting sensitive habitats and species. Following a public enquiry in 1996 the present network of rights of way and agreed horse rides which incorporates the fire track network was installed. Since then there have been few serious erosion problems and disturbance has been greatly reduced.

651561,Ahmed Thasmeen Ali,Maldives Police Capacity Building,"Maldives Police Service was introduced as a separate civilian agency during Mr. Thasmeen’s tenure as Minister of Home Affairs. He embarked on recruiting new police personnel and introduced Jail reform activities with the help from Western Australia Police to comply with international human rights norms. He started construction of a maximum security prison with a vision to improve the living condition for inmates.

The first Police Training School housed in Addu Atoll was opened under his patronage.

Many modern scientific methods of investigation in Maldives Police Service were introduced under his instruction including establishing Forensic Labs and deployment of CCTV camera in strategic points in the capital of Male'. The Community Policing concept used in policing in the Maldives is introduced under his guidance.

In a leaked cable titled PROSPECTS FOR REFORM DOMINATE DISCUSSIONS IN
MALDIVES the followings were noted:
“Home Affairs Minister Ahmed Thasmeen Ali join a
cabinet that is growing younger and more dynamic as
President Gayoom continues to make changes in an effort to
prompt progress in the Special Majlis (parliament) that is
considering constitutional reforms.

“Thasmeen Ali was keen to continue to develop the capacity of
the national police force which was split from the
National Security Service (Maldives? military) late last
year.  He also outlined plans to develop a separate well-
trained prison service and to construct a new prison on
Maahfushi Island noting that the current prison there in
which prisoners are kept in large common areas rather than
smaller cells makes it almost impossible to control or
remove individual prisoners.  He noted that his ministry
as part of the GoRM decision to invite the ICRC in to look
at prison conditions will work from ICRC standards as it
designs the new prison.”

149606,Fallow deer,Description,"
Mature buck showing common darker colouring of a winter coat with lighter area around the tail
White variants of fallow deer in Beijing Zoo
The male fallow deer is known as a buck the female is a doe and the young a fawn. Adult bucks are  long  in shoulder height and typically  in weight; does are  long  in shoulder height and  in weight. The largest bucks may measure  long and weigh . Fawns are born in spring around  and weigh around . Their lifespan is around 12–16 years.

Much variation occurs in the coat colour of the species with four main variants: common menil melanistic and leucistic – a genuine colour variety not albinistic.  The white is the lightest coloured almost white; common and menil are darker and melanistic is very dark sometimes even black (easily confused with the sika deer).

* Common: Chestnut coat with white mottles it is most pronounced in summer with a much darker unspotted coat in the winter. The light-coloured area around the tail is edged with black. The tail is light with a black stripe.
* Menil: Spots are more distinct than common in summer and no black is seen around the rump patch or on the tail. In winter spots are still clear on a darker brown coat.
* Melanistic (black): All-year the coat is black shading to greyish brown. No light-coloured tail patch or spots are seen.
* Leucistic (white but not albino): Fawns are cream-coloured; adults become pure white especially in winter. Dark eyes and nose are seen with no spots.

Most herds consist of the common coat variation yet  animals of the menil coat variation are not rare. The melanistic variation is generally rarer and white is very much rarer still although wild New Zealand herds often have a high melanistic percentage.

Only bucks have antlers which are broad and shovel-shaped (palmate) from three years. In the first two years the antler is a single spike. They are grazing animals; their preferred habitat is mixed woodland and open grassland. During the rut bucks spread out and females move between them; at this time of year fallow deer are relatively ungrouped compared to the rest of the year when they try to stay together in groups of up to 150.

Agile and fast in case of danger fallow deer can run at a maximum speed of 30 mph (48 km/h) over short distances (being naturally less muscular than other cervids such as roe deer they are not as fast). Fallow deer can also make jumps up to 1.75 m (5.8 ft) high and up to 5 m (17 ft) in length.

333385,Carl Ludvig Engel,Biography,"Carl Ludvig Engel was born in 1778 in Charlottenburg Berlin into a family of bricklayers.  It was probably as a bricklayer apprentice that he first came in contact with his future profession as an architect.  He trained at the Berlin Institute of Architecture after which he served in the Prussian building administration.  The stagnation caused by Napoleon's victory over Prussia in 1806 forced him and other architects to find work abroad.  In 1808 he applied for the position as town architect of Tallinn Estonia.  He got the job and in this way came into the vicinity of St. Petersburg and the Russian Empire.  Finland was also close by and was soon to experience a new governmental phase as a Grand Duchy under Russian rule.

Engel started working in Tallinn in 1809 but just after a few years he was forced to move on again because of a lack of assignments. From this period in Estonia a palace on Kohtu street 8 in Tallinn survives (today housing the Estonian Chancellor of Justice) and possibly Kernu manor.

From 1814 to 1815 he worked for a businessman in Turku Finland and this way he came in contact with Johan Albrecht Ehrenström who led the project of rebuilding Helsinki.  The city had just been promoted to be the new capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland.  Ehrenström was searching for a talented architect to work at his side and this meeting proved to be decisive for Carl Ludvig Engel's future career.  At this stage Engel did not however stay in Finland.  In March 1815 he travelled to St. Petersburg where he got private employment.

In 1816 Engel was planning on returning to his city of birth but at the same time Ehrenström got approval for his plan to get Engel to Helsinki.  Engel's plans for Helsinki had been shown to Czar Alexander I and in February Engel was appointed architect of the reconstruction committee for Helsinki.  Engel probably thought that this would once again be a temporary job but instead Helsinki came to be his life's work.

In 1819–1820 when Engel's first creations were nearing completion his status as a kind of head architect of the Grand Duchy was established when he received more and more building assignments both private and public in other parts of Finland. The final confirmation came when he in 1824 was appointed head of the statewide Intendant's Office responsible for all key state buildings throughout the country a position he was offered - but first refused because he still had hopes of returning to Prussia - following the resignation of its first head the Italian-born architect Carlo Bassi and which he retained until his death. Among his other key works from this period are Helsinki Old Church in Kamppi completed in 1826.

Engel died on May 14 1840 in Helsinki.

25612,George Farquhar,Early life,"
Born in Derry Farquhar was one of seven children born to William Farquhar a clergyman of modest means. The author of ""Memoirs of Mr. George Farquhar"" a biographical sketch prefixed to certain 18th century editions of his works claims that Farquhar



He was educated at Foyle College and later entered Trinity College Dublin at age 17 as a sizar under the patronage of the Bishop of Dromore who may have been related to Farquhar's mother. Farquhar may have initially intended to follow his father's profession and become a clergyman but was ""unhappy and rebellious as a student"" and left college after two years to become an actor. His 18th century biographer claims that the departure was because ""his gay and volatile Disposition could not long relish the Gravity and Retirement of a College-life"" but another story of uncertain veracity has him being expelled from Trinity College due to a ""profane jest.""

155935,Call signs in North America,Introduction,"
Call signs are frequently still used by North American broadcast stations in addition to amateur radio and other international radio stations that continue to identify by call signs around the world. Each country has a different set of patterns for its own call signs. Call signs are allocated to ham radio stations in Barbados Canada Mexico and across the United States.

Many countries have specific conventions for classifying call signs by transmitter characteristics and location. The call sign format for radio and television call signs follows a number of conventions. All call signs begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: ""AAA""–""ALZ"" ""K"" ""N"" ""W"". For a complete list see international call sign allocations.

258199,North Sydney New South Wales,History,"Aborigines on the southern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) called the north side ''warung'' which meant ''the other side'' while those on the northern side used the same name to describe the southern side.

The first name used by European settlers was ''Hunterhill'' named after a property owned by Thomas Muir of Huntershill (1765–1799) a Scottish political reformer. He purchased land in 1794 near the location of north pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is now located and built a house which he named after his childhood home. This area north to Gore Hill became known as St Leonards. The township of St Leonards was laid out in 1836 in what is now North Sydney bounded by what is now Miller Walker Lavender and Berry Streets. By 1846 there were 106 houses here and by 1859 the commercial centre had extended from Milsons Point to Miller Street. A bus service operated by Jeremiah Wall ran between Milsons Point and ''North Sydney Shops'' and North Sydney thus developed its own identity.

The North Sydney municipality was incorporated in 1890 and after naming disputes ''North Sydney'' was settled upon. The post office which opened in 1854 as St Leonards was changed to North Sydney in 1890. The first public school which opened in 1874 as St Leonards was renamed North Sydney in 1910.

North Sydney underwent a dramatic transformation into a commercial hub in 1971–72. In this period no less than 27 skyscrapers were built.

===Trams===

The history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods – the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909 when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 and the third from then until the general closure of the system in 1958.

The first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point Ferry wharf located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred St (now Alfred Street South) Junction St (now Pacific Highway) Blue St and Miller Sts to the engine house and depot in Ridge St. It used cable grip cars called ""dummies"" and un-powered trailer cars.

A feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at Wynyard railway station (the only one in Australia) and the tracks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trams ran from Blue St North Sydney over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now road lanes) through a tram platform at Milsons Point railway station before descending underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station.

In J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth the '''Paths of the Dead''' were a haunted passage under the White Mountains.

The Paths of the Dead started at the ''Dark Door'' at the end of the long valley of Harrowdale beyond the Firienfeld and the forest of Dimholt wedged in between the mountains Irensaga Starkhorn and the Dwimorberg.

After the Dark Door the Paths went under the Dwimorberg past another door where Aragorn and company found the remains of Baldor son of the second King of Rohan Brego.  The Paths then continued past forgotten cities emerging at the southern end of the White Mountains in Morthond vale near the Stone of Erech.

260212,Chopper (motorcycle),Introduction,"

Peter Fonda rides a replica of the ""Captain America"" bike used in ''Easy Rider''.

A '''chopper''' is a type of custom motorcycle which emerged in California in the late 1950s. The chopper is perhaps the most extreme of all custom styles often using radically modified steering angles and lengthened forks for a stretched-out appearance.  They can be built from an original motorcycle which is modified (""chopped"") or built from scratch. Some of the characteristic features of choppers are long front ends with extended forks often coupled with an increased rake angle hardtail frames (frames without rear suspension) very tall ""ape hanger"" or very short ""drag"" handlebars lengthened or stretched frames and larger than stock front wheels. The ""sissy bar"" a set of tubes that connect the rear fender with the frame and which are often extended several feet high is a signature feature on many choppers.

Perhaps the best known choppers are the two customized Harley-Davidsons the ""Captain America"" and ""Billy Bike"" seen in the 1969 film ''Easy Rider''.

298614,Treaty of Gulistan,Background and the Russo-Persian War,"Imperial Russia had just sworn in a new tsar Alexander I in 1801 and the empire was very eager to control neighboring territories as the tsar was determined to expand. A few years previously in Persia Fath Ali Shah Qajar also became the new shah after the assassination of his uncle Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1797. Agha Mohammad Khan had during his reign defeated and re-subordinated all of his enemies and former Afsharid/Safavid vassals and subjects in the regions of present-day Georgia Armenia southern Dagestan and Azerbaijan and claimed the areas as rightfully belonging to Persia. By the events prior during and after the Battle of Krtsanisi of 1795 he had regained full control over Eastern Georgia Dagestan Armenia and Azerbaijan. Several years later after Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in Shusha and Erekle II had died as well Russia stepped in and capitalized on the moment to annex eastern Georgia allowing unrestricted travel and trade between the regions and Russia furthering its public claim on the land. Persia was trying to align with France in 1801 to better position itself in case of war with Russia yet those attempts fell through. Ironically as both Russia and Britain were currently engaged in the Napoleonic wars Fath Ali Shah instead brokered a deal with Britain that provided Persia with military support from British troops in exchange for preventing any European country from entering India. With the alliance Persia entered into the first Russo-Persian War against a militarily pre-occupied Russia which was heavily invested in the Napoleonic Wars.

Although Persia entered the war mainly for the goal of reasserting its control over Georgia and to ensure the protection of the rest of its northwestern borders Fath Ali Shah had heard about the atrocities being committed by Russian Commanders in Georgia the commanders ruling “through massive extortion and maladministration”.

Numerically Persian forces had a considerable advantage during the war: a ratio of 5 to 1 over their Russian adversaries. However the Persian forces were technologically backwards and poorly trained - a problem that the Persian government did not recognize until a far later juncture. Despite these crippling disadvantages fighting continued in northern Persia Azerbaijan and in regions of Georgia. Persia was so enraged at Russia as to declare a jihad upon them demanding that its people unite to fight the war against them. Persia was actually losing the war and asked for military and financial aid from France’s Napoleon (with which they had a France-Persian Alliance) who promised to deliver French support regarding Iran's ambitions to regain its recently lost territory of Georgia yet France's relations with Russia were more important to them after the two countries signed the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 resulting in France leaving Persia unassisted. The Battle of Aslanduz on 31 October 1812 was the turning point in the war which led to the complete destruction of the Persian army thus leaving Fath Ali Shah with no other option but to sign the Treaty of Gulistan.

22323,Shark,Physiology,"
===Buoyancy===
Unlike bony fish sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene and their cartilage which is about half the normal density of bone. Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. The liver's effectiveness is limited so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs using it as a form of swim bladder.  Bottom-dwelling sharks like the nurse shark have negative buoyancy allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.

Some sharks if inverted or stroked on the nose enter a natural state of tonic immobility. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.

===Respiration===
Like other fish sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Unlike other fish shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks. While the shark is moving water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as ""ram ventilation"". While at rest most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are ''obligate ram ventilators'' and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.

The respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark's two-chambered heart. Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries which come together to form the dorsal aorta. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses. From there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats.

===Thermoregulation===
Most sharks are ""cold-blooded"" or more precisely poikilothermic meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile (""miraculous net""). The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature which is thought to have evolved independently.

===Osmoregulation===
In contrast to bony fish with the exception of the coelacanth the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist such as the bull shark which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.

===Digestion===
Digestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach where it is stored and initial digestion occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.

One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.

528690,Corridor D,History,"Corridor D ramp marker in Parkersburg West Virginia showing the symbol WVDOH uses for Appalachian Corridor mile and ramp markers.
One of the original 23 corridors Corridor D (U.S. Highway 50) was to provide access to major urban centers along the east coast from the midwest while creating economic development for northwest and North-Central West Virginia and southeast Ohio.

The Blennerhassett Island Bridge a tied-arch bridge opened to traffic on June 13 2008 over the Ohio River thus completing Corridor D in its entirety.

=== West Virginia ===
The earliest segment of Corridor D or US 50 to open in West Virginia was a six-mile (10 km) segment in 1967  from an isolated point near Sherwood in Doddridge County (MP 15) to WV 23 in Salem in Harrison County (MP 1.52). Two years later a segment from Salem east to CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) opened to traffic.

In 1970 major portions of Corridor D opened to traffic:
# A brief segment in Wood County from MP 8 to MP 11 near Murphytown.
# A lengthy segment in Wood County from WV 31 near Deerwalk (MP 15.41) to MP 4 at Nutter Farm in Ritchie County near North Bend State Park a distance of seven miles (11 km).
# A segment of US 50 in Ritchie County at WV 74 at Pennsboro (MP 17) east to Doddridge County at West Union (MP 5.5).

Most of Corridor D opened a year later.
# A segment four-lane upgrade of US 50 opened in Wood County from Interstate 77 east of Parkersburg (MP 4) to MP 8 near Murphytown.
# A segment within Wood County from MP 11 near Murphytown to Sandhill (MP 15.41). This connected the disjointed segments between #1 and #2 listed above.
# The majority of Ritchie County's US 50 segment opened from MP 4 near North Bend State Park to WV 74 at Pennsboro (MP 17). This connected the disjointed segments between #2 and #3 listed above.
# A segment in Doddridge County from MP 5.52 near West Union east to WV 23 near Salem (MP 15).

In 1974 a segment of Corridor D in Harrison County opened to traffic from CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) to the CR 11 at Wilsonburg (MP 11). In 1977 this was extended eastward to WV 20 at Montpelier east of Clarksburg (MP 15.5) and a year later to Interstate 79 west of Bridgeport (MP 18.25).

==== Completion into Ohio ====
Construction began in 2000 with the start of the Godbey Fields complex in Parkersburg West Virginia. The $6.5 million  athletic complex was finished in 2001. Several contracts were let soon after which included grading and drainage for part of Corridor D a new Corning Glass Bridge for WV 47 and another span that would carry US 50 over WV 47 and 7th Street in Parkersburg.

On September 8 2003 the first segment of Corridor D opened. The  four-lane controlled-access highway stretched from Interstate 77 to WV 47 in Parkersburg.

On September 20 2004 the second portion of Corridor D opened from WV 47 to WV 14 which included the construction of a Little Kanawha River crossing. With this segment open to traffic 1/3 of the Parkersburg Corridor D segment was complete.

On March 9 2005 a tied arch Ohio River crossing design was chosen from four designs as it was the ""most economical and least intrusive on the environment of Blennerhassett Island. The $120 million eight-span bridge will include an  tied arch over the main channel of the Ohio River and will stretch for  from both abutments with a  vertical clearance. It is being constructed from weathering steel and will connect WV 892 to OH 618. At the time of its contract letting in April 2005 it was the largest single highway contract in West Virginia's history. The bridge is expected to be complete in 2007.

On July 12 2005 it was announced that the final Corridor D contract in West Virginia was to be awarded. This would complete paving and signing operations of  from the WV 892 WV 95 and WV 68 interchange to River Hill Road. In Ohio a single contract was announced that would connect the Ohio River span to U.S. Route 50 which would be completed in 2007.

In August 2005 Corridor D was opened to traffic from WV 14 to WV 68.

In mid-September 2005 Corridor D was completed from Fifth Street in Parkersburg to WV 892 WV 95 and WV 68. This segment was constructed under five contracts and required the completion of ten bridges.

As of April 23 2006 construction on the Corridor D mainlines from Interstate 77 to WV 892 is all but complete. The last segment from WV 892 to the WV 892 WV 95 and WV 68 interchange was slated to open in August.

On August 31 2006 it was announced that from WV 892/WV 68 to the WV 892 interchange Corridor D was open to traffic. This  four-lane divided freeway is the final roadway section of the corridor from Clarksburg and Cincinnati without the Ohio River crossing.

The last Corridor D project the Blennerhasset Bridge crossing the Ohio River was opened on June 13 2008.

There are long-range plans to expand the diamond interchange at Interstate 77 into a fully directional interchange at a cost of $60 million. It is ranked 75th.

===Club===
Thoresen started his career in Larvik Turn but travelled abroad at the age of seventeen and soon became a regular at FC Twente in the Netherlands. They won the Dutch Cup in 1977 and Thoresen was bought by giants PSV Eindhoven where he formed a dynamic tandem with Jurrie Koolhof in the 1980s. Helping capturing three league titles Thoresen was a key player for seven years serving as captain from 1983–1986 until he returned to Norway and played for Frigg in the lower divisions. Troubled by an injury he was forced to retire from his playing career shortly thereafter.

===International===
He played 50 matches for the Norway national football team and scored 9 goals one of which secured the historic victory over England in 1981. Thoresen is among the six Norwegian internationals who have never played in the Norwegian Premier League.

===Managerial===
He did assume the coaching position at Frigg later moving on to coach larger clubs like Brann Strømsgodset Hønefoss Skeid and Lillestrøm (assistant). He is currently in charge of the Norway U21. Odd Grenland announced on 30 October 2006 that Thoresen had agreed to take over as the clubs Director of Football although it is not yet known when he will leave his post with the Norway U21 team.

Thoresen played Norwegian football player and Allied POW Gunnar Hilsson in the 1981 film ''Escape to Victory''. He is also a supporter of Arsenal to the point where he opened a pub Oslo Norway called Highbury.

The NWL changed to a short season league in 1966 and that season opened in Eugene against the Lewiston Broncs. The second pick in the 1966 MLB draft future hall of famer Reggie Jackson played his first professional games at Bethel Park as a 20-year-old center fielder following his sophomore season at Arizona State. Hitless in the opener the next game he got his first pro hit a single in the first and later a home run to right field in the ninth.

In the 1969 season the Emeralds were promoted to AAA status in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) as the primary affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Ems returned to the Northwest League five years later when the Phillies moved their AAA farm team to the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the 1974 season. Eugene was independent that season then became an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds in 1975.

As a Triple A team in 1969 the Emeralds moved from Bethel Park to Civic Stadium. The 6800-seat facility was owned by the Eugene School District and was built in 1938 as a venue for high school football which was played there until 1968. Civic Stadium also hosted semi-pro baseball teams sponsored by local timber companies until Bethel Park was built in 1950. Facing an outdated stadium and high-maintenance costs the Eugene Emeralds moved into the new baseball stadium across town that was built by the University of Oregon PK Park. A vacant Civic Stadium was destroyed by fire in 2015 several years after the Emeralds had been playing at PK Park. The Emeralds new home PK Park is adjacent to Autzen Stadium and near the Willamette River. They share the new facility with the Oregon Ducks whose regular season ends in May.

A new logo based upon Sasquatch was adopted by the Emeralds in 2012. In 2013 the Emeralds partnered with Voodoo Doughnut to offer a bacon maple bratwurst as a specialty food item. Following the 2014 season the Emeralds switched from being an affiliate of the San Diego Padres to the Chicago Cubs who signed Eugene to a two-year deal through 2016. The player development contract was extended through the 2018 season on June 14 2016.

690917,Concerning Hobbits,Introduction,"'''""Concerning Hobbits""''' is an acclaimed piece by composer Howard Shore for ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' soundtrack. It is a concert suite of the music of the Hobbits arranged from the music heard in the film during the early Shire scenes and features the various themes and leitmotifs composed for the Shire and Hobbits and is intended to evoke feelings of peace. It is also the title of one of the sections of the prologue to ''The Lord of the Rings'' by J. R. R. Tolkien. Excerpts of the piece can be heard during an extended scene in the 2012 film ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey''. The piece has become synonymous with the Shire theme.

Although the tin whistle and violin both have solos and have the main melodies throughout the piece it is also noted for Shore's distinctive use of the bodhrán to create a heartbeat-like sound. Other accompaniment instruments include a celtic harp hammered dulcimer musette-type accordion drones classical guitars mandolin low whistle and recorders.

One of the chief tracks of the entire trilogy it is also one of the happiest tracks with others invoking feelings of heroism or foreboding. It show-cases the Shire theme or Hobbits' theme in its main ""pensive"" orchestral setting: A stepwise melody played by strings a solo fiddle or a tin whistle. The B-section of the theme is often played by strings tutti to a very expansive effect arguably forming a separate theme altogether.

Also in the piece is a ""rural"" or ""folk"" setting or variation labeled by musicologist Doug Adams as a separate theme for Hobbiton played by solo fiddle and various celtic instruments in accompaniment. The chords of the third main shire theme the ""hymn"" variant (which later serves mostly as Frodo's theme) also play briefly under the melody.

The melody is accompanied by several motifs:
*Hobbit Outline Figure: This simple figure often heard in the cellos and double basses is used as an expectation of things to come. It is heard quite a bit in the early Shire scenes portraying the hobbits' playful sides.
*Hobbit Two Step Figure: This short figure appears frequently during the introduction of the Shire and it often concludes with the End Cap figure.
*Hobbit Skip Beat: This ostinato figure is heard throughout the Shire material usually as an accompaniment but sometimes more prominently.
*Hobbit End Cap: A graceful rim-shot that plays to the good-humored hobbit lifestyle.
*The Heartbeat of the Shire: played on Bodhran.
Also in the piece (about a minute into the track) is a cadence that closes a statement of the Hobbiton theme which coincides with Bilbo's ""Happy Birthday"" sign being erected. This motif was also used in ""Old Friends"" in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turning it after-the-fact into a theme for Bilbo's birthday party Preparations.

The piece has alternates in the Complete Recording tracks ""The Shire"" and ""Bag End"" (which are the Extended Edition recording) in the Fan-Credits of the Fellowship of the Ring (where the fiddler is allowed to improvise more around the Hobbiton theme) and in the Lord of the Rings Symphony which features the whole suite.

194035,Lantibiotics,History,"
The name lantibiotics was introduced in 1988 as an abbreviation for ""lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics"". The first structures of these antimicrobial agents were produced by pioneering work by Gross and Morell in the late 1960s and early 1970s thus marking the formal introduction of lantibiotics. Since then lantibiotics such as nisin have been used auspiciously for food preservation and have yet to encounter significant bacterial resistance. These attributes of lantibiotics have led to more detailed research into their structures and biosynthetic pathways.

===Kickback Trial and Imprisonment===
Marcinko was indicted for conspiracy conflict of interest and lying to the government on July 13 1989 in connection with a kickback of $113000 paid to Ramco International a company set up by Marcinko and former SEAL John B. Mason by Accuracy Systems a Phoenix Arizona-based arms manufacturer owned by Charles M. Byers another former SEAL. Byers was convicted of conspiracy and conflict of interest on October 20 1989 but Marcinko was acquitted of conflict of interest.

Marcinko was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government on January 24 1990. The jury in that trial also acquitted Marcinko of a separate count of bribery.

On March 9 1990 Marcinko was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and fined $10000 under charges of defrauding the government over the price of contractor acquisitions for hand grenades. Marcinko maintains that he was the subject of a witch-hunt for his work with Red Cell and that the fraud committed revealed the weaknesses of military security. Marcinko detailed his arrest and confinement in the last chapters of his autobiography.

===Civilian life===
Marcinko has since published a VHS and DVD movie account of his ""Red Cell"" operations.

His experiences led him to write his autobiography ''The New York Times'' best-selling ''Rogue Warrior'' and subsequent fictional sequels most of which are co-written with ghostwriter John Weisman. With Weisman he co-authored a three book series on leadership management and team-building for business executives.

He is currently CEO of Red Cell International and formerly of SOS Temps Inc. a private security consulting firm based in Washington D.C. He had a politically conservative talk radio show ''America on Watch with Dick Marcinko'' which was broadcast live. He is a spokesman for the Zodiac boat company's Zodiac Maritime Training Academy and served as a consultant on FOX's television series ''24''. He briefly collaborated with Strider Knives on a series of knife designs referred to as the ""RW"" signifying ""Rogue Warrior"" from 2008 to 2010.

206586,ZeD,Reception,"''ZeD'' was nominated for an Emmy Award.  The series was nominated for Gemini Awards including for Best Music Best Variety Program or Series Best Visual Effects and Best Cross Platform Project.  Tong was also nominated for a 2005 Gemini Award for Viewer's Choice for Lifestyle Host.  In 2002 television critic Alex Strachan wrote that ""Almost everything about ZeD is exactly right from its sense of timing... to the lack of commercials"" and that Sharon Lewis' style was nicely easygoing.  That year 70000 watched the show which was aimed at people in their twenties and thirties who were comfortable with technology.  Still the executive producer Mashingaidze-Greaves admitted that ""millions of Canadians"" did not know what ''ZeD'' was during its run.

The sexual content of the website and series was sometimes controversial. In 2002 some of CBC's critics on the website CBC Watch preferred to see the sexual content unaired and CBC quoted them as predicting that ""''ZeD'' will mostly be remembered for taking the 'L' out of public broadcasting.""  ''ZeD'' also received letters from viewers who thought one short film featuring a sexual scene between brothers was unusual. ''ZeD'' explained that ""ZeD isn't about gratuitous nudity or being gross just for the sake of being gross. Don't get us wrong. We're not squeamish about anything... except outright stupidity.""

Current TV a television channel launched by politician Al Gore in 2005 was partially influenced by ''ZeD''.  This led Mashingaidze-Greaves to express ''ZeD'' had ""the world leaders in interactive television without a doubt.""  Mashingaidze-Greaves also said he did not fear having a larger rival in ''Current TV'' and said ''ZeD'' would continually innovate itself.

263078,Emil Jellinek,Early life,"Jellinek was born in Leipzig Germany the son of Dr Adolf Jellinek (sometimes known also as Aaron Jellinek). His father was a well-known Czech-Hungarian rabbi and intellectual in the Jewish collective around Leipzig and Vienna. Jellinek's mother Rosalie Bettelheim (born 1832 in Budapest died 1892 in Baden bei Wien) was an active rebbitzen. He had two brothers both of whom achieved fame: Max Hermann Jellinek as a linguist and Georg Jellinek as an international law teacher. His sisters were Charlotte and Pauline.

The family moved shortly after Jellinek's birth to Vienna. He found paying attention to school work difficult and dropped out of several schools including Sonderhausen. His parents were displeased with his performance while Jellinek began to indulge in practical jokes. In 1870 when he was 17 his parents found him a job as a clerk in a Moravian railway company Rot-Koestelec North-Western. Jellinek lasted two years at this company before being sacked when the management discovered that he had been organising train races late at night.

702892,Franz Babinger,Life,"Babinger was born in Weiden in der Oberpfalz Bavaria and was already an accomplished academic and linguist by the time he had completed his secondary school studies. Prior to starting University he had already learned both Persian and Hebrew.

Babinger completed his doctoral studies at the University of Munich on the eve of World War I; after the war started he joined the German Army. Because of his language skills and abilities Babinger served in the Middle East thus avoiding the deadly trench warfare that cut short the lives of many promising scholars of his generation.

After the war Babinger continued his studies at Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität in Berlin where he completed his Habilitationsschrift in 1921 and became a Professor at the same institution. During this period he published ''Geschichtsschreiber der Osmanen und ihre Werke'' (""Historians of the Ottoman Empire"") which became the standard bibliographical review of Ottoman historiography and confirmed the reputation of Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität as a leading center for Near East studies. The rise of the Nazis to power in 1933 forced him to resign his position. However the Romanian statesman academic and polymath Nicolae Iorga himself a widely respected historian of the Ottoman Empire invited Babinger to take up a position in Bucharest which he held until he was ordered out of the country in 1943.

Babinger resumed his teaching career after the Second World War at the University of Munich in 1948 until his retirement in 1958. In 1957 he testified about German atrocities against Romanian Jews. He continued to work and publish actively until his accidental death by drowning in Albania on June 23 1967.

588881,Pierce the Ploughman's Crede,Textual history,"Surviving in two complete 14th-century manuscripts and two early printed editions the ''Crede'' can be dated on internal evidence to the short period between 1393 and 1400. The two manuscripts both include ''Piers Plowman'' and in the first the ''Crede'' serves as an introduction to a C-text version of ''Piers Plowman''. Additionally BL MS Harley 78 contains a fragment of the ''Crede'' copied c. 1460–70.

The ''Crede'' was first printed in London by Reyner Wolfe and then reprinted for inclusion with Owen Rogers's 1561 reprint of Robert Crowley's 1550 edition of ''Piers Plowman''. The ''Crede'' was not printed again until Thomas Bensley's edition in 1814 based on that of 1553 and Thomas Wright's of 1832. The 1553 and 1561 editions were altered to include more anticlericalism and to attack an ""abbot"" where the original text had ""bishop"". This latter revision is a conservative one undoubtedly motivated by the security of attacking a defunct institution following the Dissolution of the Monasteries rather than an aspect of Catholicism which survived in the Church of England. Nearly all modern critics have agreed that several lines about transubstantiation were removed. This excision was covered with a (perhaps interpolated) passage not found in any of the manuscripts.

The poem exists in several modern editions: Thomas Wright and Walter Skeat produced independent versions in the 19th century; more recently James Dean has edited the text for TEAMs and Helen Barr has produced an annotated edition in ''The Piers Plowman Tradition'' (London: J.M. Dent 1993) ().

3431,Christianity and Judaism,Jewish self-identification," 
Judaism's purpose is to carry out what it holds to be the only Covenant between God and the Jewish people. The Torah (lit. ""teaching"") both written and oral tell the story of this covenant and provides Jews with the terms of the covenant. The Oral Torah is the primary guide for Jews to abide by these terms as expressed in tractate Gittin 60b ""the Holy One Blessed be He did not make His covenant with Israel except by virtue of the Oral Law"" to help them learn how to live a holy life and to bring holiness peace and love into the world and into every part of life so that life may be elevated to a high level of kedushah originally through study and practice of the Torah and since the destruction of the Second Temple through prayer as expressed in tractate Sotah 49a ""Since the destruction of the Temple every day is more cursed than the preceding one; and the existence of the world is assured only by the kedusha...and the words spoken after the study of Torah."" Since the adoption of the Amidah the acknowledgement of God through the declaration from Yishayah 6:3 ""Kadosh holy kadosh kadosh is HaShem Master of Legions; the whole world is filled with His glory"". as a replacement for the study of Torah which is a daily obligation for a Jew and sanctifies God in itself. This continuous maintenance of relationship between the individual Jew and God through either study or prayer repeated three times daily is the confirmation of the original covenant. This allows the Jewish people as a community to strive and fulfill the prophecy ""I the Lord have called you in righteousness and will hold your hand and keep you. And I will establish you as a Covenant of the people for a light unto the nations."" () (i.e. a role model) over the course of history and a part of the divine intent of bringing about an age of peace and sanctity where ideally a faithful life and good deeds should be ends in themselves not means. See also Jewish principles of faith.

According to Christian theologian Alister McGrath the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of then contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the messiah with Isaiah 49:6 ""an explicit parallel to 42:6"" quoted by Paul in Acts 13:47 and reinterpreted by Justin the Martyr. According to Christian writers most notably Paul the Bible teaches that people are in their current state sinful and the New Testament reveals that Jesus is both the Son of man and the Son of God united in the hypostatic union God the Son God made incarnate; that Jesus' death by crucifixion was a sacrifice to atone for all of humanity's sins and that acceptance of Jesus as Savior and Lord saves one from Divine Judgment giving Eternal life. Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant. His famous Sermon on the Mount is considered by some Christian scholars to be the proclamation of the New Covenant ethics in contrast to the Mosaic Covenant of Moses from Mount Sinai.

The '''Coup d'état of December Twelfth''' (Hangul: 12.12 군사반란; Hanja: 12.12 軍事叛亂) or the ""'''12.12 Military Insurrection'''"" was a military coup d'état which took place on December 12 1979 in South Korea.

Republic of Korea Army Major General Chun Doo-hwan commander of the Security Command acting without authorization from Acting President Choi Kyu-ha ordered the arrest of General Jeong Seung-hwa ROK Army Chief of Staff on allegations of involvement in the assassination of President Park Chung Hee. 

After Jeong's capture 29th Regiment of the 9th Division along with the 1st and 3rd Airborne Brigades invaded downtown Seoul to support the 30th and 33rd Capital Security Group loyal to Chun then a series of conflicts broke out in the capital. Two of Jeong's allies Major General Jang Tae-wan (Capital Security commander) and Major General Jeong Byeong Ju (special forces commander) were also arrested by the rebel troops. Major Kim Oh-rang Aide-de-camp of Jeong Byeong Ju was killed during the gun-fight. 

By the next morning the Ministry of Defense and Army HQ were all occupied. Chun and his fellow 11th class of Korea Military Academy graduates such as Major General Roh Tae-woo commanding general of 9th Infantry Division and Major General Jeong Ho-yong were in charge of the Korean military. Chun was supported in the coup and the subsequent consolidation of power by the powerful private club of military officials called Hanahoe.

The Coup d'état of December Twelfth and the Coup d'état of May Seventeenth ended the Fourth Republic of South Korea and led to the Fifth Republic of South Korea.

382730,Programme for International Student Assessment,Framework,"PISA stands in a tradition of international school studies undertaken since the late 1950s by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). Much of PISA's methodology follows the example of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS started in 1995) which in turn was much influenced by the U.S. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The reading component of PISA is inspired by the IEA's Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

PISA aims at testing literacy in three competence fields: reading mathematics science on a 1000-point scale.

The PISA mathematics literacy test asks students to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve problems set in real-world contexts. To solve the problems students must activate a number of mathematical competencies as well as a broad range of mathematical content knowledge. TIMSS on the other hand measures more traditional classroom content such as an understanding of fractions and decimals and the relationship between them (curriculum attainment). PISA claims to measure education's application to real-life problems and lifelong learning (workforce knowledge).

In the reading test ""OECD/PISA does not measure the extent to which 15-year-old students are fluent readers or how competent they are at word recognition tasks or spelling."" Instead they should be able to ""construct extend and reflect on the meaning of what they have read across a wide range of continuous and non-continuous texts.""

588929,Kensington Philadelphia,Introduction,"



'''Kensington''' is a neighborhood in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. It is between the Lower Northeast section of Philadelphia and North Philadelphia. Not to be confused with the former Kensington District now commonly referred to as Fishtown. As with all neighborhoods in Philadelphia the lack of any official designation means the boundaries of the area vary between sources and over time.

Traditionally Kensington is known for its large working class Irish Catholic community. Kensington was the location of the Philadelphia Nativist Riots in the 19th century. Kensington is also the birthplace of the K&A Gang (currently known as the Northeast Philly Irish Mob) an Irish American organized crime network. Kensington was also home to a large and largely invisible English American community. For example the five Episcopal parishes in the neighborhood (Emmanuel Free Church of St. John Good Shepherd St. Ambrose St. Luke's and St. Nathanael's) were founded by 19th century immigrants from England. 

Along with Irish Americans Kensington is also home to a large population of Hispanic Americans (mainly Puerto Ricans) African Americans Polish Americans and Italian Americans. The neighborhood has also recently seen a large influx of young urban professionals and gentrification.

207400,Yellow-casqued hornbill,Introduction,"

The '''yellow-casqued hornbill''' (''Ceratogymna elata'') also known as the '''yellow-casqued wattled hornbill''' is found in the rainforest of coastal regions of West Africa for example in Côte d'Ivoire.

The yellow-casqued hornbill is one of the largest birds of the West African forest with adults weighing up to .  They live mainly in the forest canopy rarely feeding on the ground.  They live in small family groups containing at least one adult male and female with one or two immature birds though they sometimes gather in larger flocks to exploit a major food supply such as an ant or termite nest.

The birds are occasionally preyed upon by crowned hawk-eagles and they respond to the presence of an eagle (sometimes indicated by its characteristic shriek) by mobbing – approaching it and emitting calls.  Since the eagles depend on surprise to make a catch this frequently causes them to leave the area.  Recent research (Rainey et al. 2004) has shown that the birds respond in the same way to the alarm calls that Diana monkeys which live in the same areas emit if they notice an eagle and that they can distinguish the calls made by the monkeys in the presence of eagles from those they make in the presence of leopards which prey on the monkeys but not on the hornbills.

277321,X-ray pulsar,Spin behaviors,"Radio pulsars (rotation-powered pulsars) and X-ray pulsars exhibit very different spin behaviors and have different mechanisms producing their characteristic pulses although it is accepted that both kinds of pulsar are manifestations of a rotating magnetized neutron star. The rotation cycle of the neutron star in both cases is identified with the pulse period.

The major differences are that radio pulsars have periods on the order of milliseconds to seconds and all radio pulsars are losing angular momentum and slowing down. In contrast the X-ray pulsars exhibit a variety of spin behaviors. Some X-ray pulsars are observed to be continuously spinning faster and faster or slower and slower (with occasional reversals in these trends) while others show either little change in pulse period or display erratic spin-down and spin-up behavior.

The explanation of this difference can be found in the physical nature of the two pulsar classes. Over 99% of radio pulsars are single objects that radiate away their rotational energy in the form of relativistic particles and magnetic dipole radiation lighting up any nearby nebulae that surround them. In contrast X-ray pulsars are members of binary star systems and accrete matter from either stellar winds or accretion disks. The accreted matter transfers angular momentum to (or from) the neutron star causing the spin rate to increase or decrease at rates that are often hundreds of times faster than the typical spin down rate in radio pulsars. Exactly why the X-ray pulsars show such varied spin behavior is still not clearly understood.

In tropical and subtropical climates its incidence has been reported as between 0.015 percent and 2.0 percent of the population. Up to now only a few cases had been reported in Europe. Ainhum usually affects people between 20 and 50 years. The average age is about thirty-eight. The youngest recorded patient was seven years old.

The commission was empowered to grant amnesty to those who committed abuses during the apartheid era as long as the crimes were politically motivated proportionate and there was full disclosure by the person seeking amnesty. To avoid victor's justice no side was exempt from appearing before the commission. The commission heard reports of human rights violations and considered amnesty applications from all sides from the apartheid state to the liberation forces including the African National Congress.

Like many hypnotics it should not be combined with other antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) as this combination can increase the risk of serious side effects. Using doxylamine over a long period of time is not recommended. However the drug is not addictive and withdrawal effects are unlikely to be experienced with prolonged use.

128201,Chang and Eng Bunker,Later years and death,"The Bunkers in their later years
In 1870 Chang suffered a stroke and his health declined over the next four years. He also began drinking heavily (Chang's drinking did not affect Eng as they did not share a circulatory system). Despite his brother's ailing condition Eng remained in good health. Shortly before his death Chang was injured after falling from a carriage. He then developed a severe case of bronchitis. On January 17 1874 Chang died while the brothers were asleep. Eng awoke to find his brother dead and cried ""Then I am going"". A doctor was summoned to perform an emergency separation but he was too late. Eng died approximately three hours later.

An autopsy revealed that Chang had died of a cerebral blood clot but Eng's cause of death remains uncertain. Doctors of the time theorized that Eng died of shock due to fear of his impending death. They based that theory on the fact that Eng's bladder had distended with urine and his right testicle had retracted. Two North Carolina neurologists Dr. Paul D. Morte and Dr. E. Wayne Massey reviewed the case and concluded that Chang likely died of pulmonary edema and heart failure. They also dismissed the claim that Eng died of shock and attributed the muscle cramping that caused his testicle to retract to ""acrocyanosis from induced vasospasm and microthrombi due to disseminated intravascular coagulation the tissue factor released from necrotic tissue and the endotoxin from sepsis activating coagulation cascade"".

Sarah Anne Bunker (Eng's widow) died on April 29 1892 and Adelaide Bunker (Chang's widow) died on May 21 1917.

205837,Interstate 285,In popular culture,"Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez became widely associated with I-285 after he got lost on it while trying to drive to a game. On August 19 1982 Perez who had just received his first U.S. driver's license decided to drive himself to Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (where the Braves played their home games at the time) where he was scheduled to start that evening's game against the Montreal Expos. He was unable to find the proper exit and circled the city several times before running out of gas and calling for help. When Pérez failed to arrive at the stadium by game time the Braves called upon veteran pitcher Phil Niekro to make the emergency start. The Braves who had been mired in a 2-19 slump won the game kicking off a 13-2 winning streak which carried the team to the National League West division title. The team subsequently made for Pérez a warm-up jacket with the notation ""I-285"" in place of his uniform number. The humor of the incident was credited for helping to improve the morale of the team and breaking the losing streak.

The ''South Park'' episode ""Goobacks"" features I-285 as the location of the time portal. The interstate sign for I-285 north is shown multiple times as the time travelers appear. However this is most likely a mistake as US 285 not I-285 actually travels through the area of Colorado on which ''South Park'' is based.

In 2008 Atlanta native and hip-hop artist Ludacris released a song about I-285 entitled: ""285 (Drinkin & Driving)""

East-Atlanta based hip-hop artist Gucci Mane referenced the interstate's circular pattern in his 2007 song ""I Might Be"" saying ""On 285 I keep ridin' in a circle the inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple"".

She is usually described as small or slender with long blonde or light brown hair (most often curly) which she tends to with gold or silver combs woven from sun or moonbeams.  The origin of the Asturian word ''xana'' is unclear though some scholars see it as a derivation from the Latin name for the goddess Diana. References to where the mythological xanas lived are still common in Asturian toponyms. They also appear in Eastern Galician and Cantabrian mythology (Anjanas).

374981,Runnymede,History,"Runnymede's historical significance has been heavily influenced by its proximity to the Roman Road river crossing at nearby Staines-upon-Thames.

The name Runnymede may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon ''runieg'' (regular meeting) and ''mede'' (mead or meadow) describing a place in the meadows used to hold regular meetings. The Witan Witenagemot or Council of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of the 7th to 11th centuries was held from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of Alfred the Great. The Council met usually in the open air. This political organ was transformed in succeeding years influencing the creation of England's 13th century parliament.

The water-meadow at Runnymede is the most likely location at which in 1215 King John sealed Magna Carta. The charter indicates Runnymede by name as ""Ronimed. inter Windlesoram et Stanes"" (between Windsor and Staines). Magna Carta affected common and constitutional law as well as political representation also affecting the development of parliament.

Runnymede's association with ideals of democracy limitation of power equality and freedom under law has attracted placement there of monuments and commemorative symbols.

The last fatal duel in England took place in 1852 on Priest Hill a continuation of Cooper's Hill by Windsor Great Park.

The National Trust land was donated in 1929 by Cara Rogers Broughton and her two sons. The American-born widow of Urban Hanlon Broughton she was permitted by letter from George V to join her son's new peerage in tribute to her husband and this gift and be officially styled Lady Fairhaven. The gift was given in memory of Urban Broughton. At the time the ''New Bedford Standard-Times'' commented ""It must be a source of gratification to all Americans and especially to us here and in Fairhaven that the presentation of this historic spot as public ground has been brought about by an American woman an appropriate enough circumstance considering that the great charter underlies the USA's conception of government and human rights.""

===Runnymede Eco Village===

Between 2012 and 2015 Cooper's Hill was occupied by a radical community living in self-build houses huts benders and tents in the self-proclaimed ""Runnymede Eco Village"". Around 40 people including a few young families lived in a dispersed settlement throughout the 4 acres of woodland. They used mainly reclaimed material to build living structures solar power to generate electricity wood burners for heat cultivated some vegetables and kept chickens and geese. Water was obtained from springs on the site and the village was largely hidden from view from outside the woodland. The members called themselves ""Diggers"" after the 17th-century movement of that name. There were two unsuccessful attempts to evict the settlers in the first year of occupation; and on 30 March 2015 a further High Court trespass notice was served by bailiffs on behalf of the landowners Orchard Runnymede Ltd. The settlers were still in occupation during the Magna Carta 800th anniversary celebrations on 15 June but their presence did not affect proceedings and the eviction was completed at a later date.

This is only discovered in later episodes as his parents' health deteriorates and through an exchange with a colleague who presumed that Kavanagh was actually a Yorkshireman. The series deals with his battles in the courtroom as well as his domestic dramas which include the death of his devoted and affectionate wife. Later he begins dating a fellow barrister.

In court Kavanagh is usually seen to be defending a client who seems likely to be convicted until a twist in the case occurs but occasionally Kavanagh is seen in a prosecuting role. The main plot often features Kavanagh confronting cases with a subtext of racism sexism or other prejudice.  In sub-plots comedy came from the pomposity and self-absorption of Jeremy a posh barrister in chambers. Kavanagh will not stand for injustice and is never bullied by threats or bribes from those whom he is up against in the courtroom.

8014,Kazakhstan,Economy,"

A proportional representation of Kazakhstan's exports.
Baikonur Cosmodrome is the world's oldest and largest operational space launch facility.

Kazakhstan has the largest and strongest performing economy in Central Asia. Supported by rising oil output and prices Kazakhstan’s economy grew at an average of 8% per year until 2013 before suffering a slowdown in 2014 and 2015 Kazakhstan was the first former Soviet Republic to repay all of its debt to the International Monetary Fund 7 years ahead of schedule.

Buoyed by high world crude oil prices GDP growth figures were between 8.9% and 13.5% from 2000 to 2007 before decreasing to 1–3% in 2008 and 2009 and then rising again from 2010. Other major exports of Kazakhstan include wheat textiles and livestock. Kazakhstan is a leading exporter of uranium.

Kazakhstan’s economy grew by 4.6% in 2014. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Ukrainian crisis The country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014. Another 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.

Kazakhstan’s fiscal situation is stable. The government has continued to follow a conservative fiscal policy by controlling budget spending and accumulating oil revenue savings in its Oil Fund – Samruk-Kazyna. The global financial crisis forced Kazakhstan to increase its public borrowing to support the economy. Public debt increased to 13.4 per cent in 2013 from 8.7 per cent in 2008. Between 2012 and 2013 the government achieved an overall fiscal surplus of 4.5 per cent.

Since 2002 Kazakhstan has sought to manage strong inflows of foreign currency without sparking inflation. Inflation has not been under strict control however registering 6.6% in 2002 6.8% in 2003 and 6.4% in 2004.

In March 2002 the US Department of Commerce granted Kazakhstan market economy status under US trade law. This change in status recognised substantive market economy reforms in the areas of currency convertibility wage rate determination openness to foreign investment and government control over the means of production and allocation of resources.

===Economic stewardship during the Global Financial Crisis===
Kazakhstan weathered the global financial crisis well by combining fiscal relaxation with monetary stabilisation. In 2009 the government introduced large-scale support measures such as the recapitalisation of banks and support for the real estate and agricultural sectors as well as for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The total value of the stimulus programs amounted to $21 billion or 20 per cent of the country’s GDP with $4 billion going to stabilise the financial sector. During the global economic crisis Kazakhstan’s economy contracted by 1.2% in 2009 while the annual growth rate subsequently increased to 7.5% and 5% in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

In September 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the CIS to receive an investment grade credit rating from a major international credit rating agency. As of late December 2003 Kazakhstan's gross foreign debt was about $22.9 billion. Total governmental debt was $4.2 billion 14% of GDP. There has been a reduction in the ratio of debt to GDP. The ratio of total governmental debt to GDP in 2000 was 21.7%; in 2001 it was 17.5% and in 2002 it was 15.4%.

Economic growth combined with earlier tax and financial sector reforms has dramatically improved government finance from the 1999 budget deficit level of 3.5% of GDP to a deficit of 1.2% of GDP in 2003. Government revenues grew from 19.8% of GDP in 1999 to 22.6% of GDP in 2001 but decreased to 16.2% of GDP in 2003. In 2000 Kazakhstan adopted a new tax code in an effort to consolidate these gains.

On 29 November 2003 the Law on Changes to Tax Code which reduced tax rates was adopted. The value added tax fell from 16% to 15% the social tax from 21% to 20% and the personal income tax from 30% to 20%. On 7 July 2006 the personal income tax was reduced even further to a flat rate of 5% for personal income in the form of dividends and 10% for other personal income. Kazakhstan furthered its reforms by adopting a new land code on 20 June 2003 and a new customs code on 5 April 2003.

Energy is the leading economic sector. Production of crude oil and natural gas condensate from the oil and gas basins of Kazakhstan amounted to  in 2012 up from  in 2003. Kazakhstan raised oil and gas condensate exports to 44.3 million tons in 2003 13% higher than in 2002. Gas production in Kazakhstan in 2003 amounted to  up 22.7% compared to 2002 including natural gas production of . Kazakhstan holds about  of proven recoverable oil reserves and  of gas. According to industry analysts expansion of oil production and the development of new fields will enable the country to produce as much as  per day by 2015 and Kazakhstan would be among the top 10 oil-producing nations in the world. Kazakhstan's oil exports in 2003 were valued at more than $7 billion representing 65% of overall exports and 24% of the GDP. Major oil and gas fields and recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with ; Karachaganak with  and  of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to .

Aktau is Kazakhstan's only seaport on the Caspian Sea
Kazakhstan instituted an ambitious pension reform program in 1998. As of 1 January 2012 the pension assets were about $17 billion (KZT 2.5 trillion). There are 11 saving pension funds in the country. The State Accumulating Pension Fund the only state-owned fund was privatised in 2006. The country's unified financial regulatory agency oversees and regulates the pension funds. The growing demand of the pension funds for quality investment outlets triggered rapid development of the debt securities market. Pension fund capital is being invested almost exclusively in corporate and government bonds including government of Kazakhstan Eurobonds. The government of Kazakhstan is studying a project to create a unified national pension fund and transfer all the accounts from the private pension funds into it.

The banking system of Kazakhstan is developing rapidly and the system's capitalisation now exceeds $1 billion. The National Bank has introduced deposit insurance in its campaign to strengthen the banking sector. Due to troubling and non-performing bad assets the bank sector yet is at risk to lose stability. Several major foreign banks have branches in Kazakhstan including RBS Citibank and HSBC. Kookmin and UniCredit have both recently entered the Kazakhstan's financial services market through acquisitions and stake-building.

According to the 2010–11 World Economic Forum in Global Competitiveness Report Kazakhstan was ranked 72nd in the world in economic competitiveness. 
One year later the Global Competitiveness Report ranked Kazakhstan 50th in most competitive markets.

In 2012 Kazakhstan attracted $14 billion of foreign direct investment inflows into the country at a 7% growth rate making it the most attractive place to invest out of CIS nations.

During the first half of 2013 Kazakhstan's fixed investment increased 7.1% compared to the same period in 2012 totalling 2.8 trillion tenge ($18 billion US dollars).

In 2013 ''Aftenposten'' quoted the human-rights activist and lawyer Denis Jivaga as saying that there is an ""oil fund in Kazakhstan but nobody knows how the income is spent"".

===Macroeconomic trends===
Kazakhstan’s economy grew at an average of 8% per year over the past decade on the back of hydrocarbon exports. Despite the lingering uncertainty of the global economy Kazakhstan’s economy has been stable. GDP growth in January–September 2013 was 5.7% according to preliminary calculations of the Ministry Economy and Budget Planning.

From January to September 2014 Kazakhstan's GDP grew at 4%. According to the results from the first half of the year the current account surplus is $6.6 billion a figure two times higher than that of the first half of 2013. According to the Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan Kairat Kelimbetov the increase was caused by a trade surplus of 17.4 percent or approximately USD 22.6 billion. The overall inflation rate for 2014 is forecasted at 7.4 percent.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture accounts for approximately 5% of Kazakhstan's GDP. Grain potatoes vegetables melons and livestock are the most important agricultural commodities. Agricultural land occupies more than . The available agricultural land consists of  of arable land and  of pasture and hay land. Over 80% of the country’s total area is classified as agricultural land including almost 70% occupied by pasture. Its arable land has the second highest availability per inhabitant (1.5 hectares).

Chief livestock products are dairy products leather meat and wool. The country's major crops include wheat barley cotton and rice. Wheat exports a major source of hard currency rank among the leading commodities in Kazakhstan's export trade. In 2003 Kazakhstan harvested 17.6 million tons of grain in gross 2.8% higher compared to 2002. Kazakh agriculture still has many environmental problems from mismanagement during its years in the Soviet Union. Some Kazakh wine is produced in the mountains to the east of Almaty.

Kazakhstan is thought to be one of the places that the apple originated particularly the wild ancestor of ''Malus domestica'' ''Malus sieversii''. It has no common name in English but is known in its native Kazakhstan as ''alma''. The region where it is thought to originate is called ''Almaty'': ""rich with apple"". This tree is still found wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Xinjiang in China.

===Natural resources===

Kazakhstan has an abundant supply of accessible mineral and fossil fuel resources. Development of petroleum natural gas and mineral extractions has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13% of gross domestic product). According to some estimates Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium chromium lead and zinc reserves the third largest manganese reserves the fifth largest copper reserves and ranks in the top ten for coal iron and gold. It is also an exporter of diamonds. Perhaps most significant for economic development Kazakhstan also currently has the 11th largest proven reserves of both petroleum and natural gas.

In total there are 160 deposits with over  of petroleum. Oil explorations have shown that the deposits on the Caspian shore are only a small part of a much larger deposit. It is said that  of oil and  of gas could be found in that area. Overall the estimate of Kazakhstan's oil deposits is . However there are only 3 refineries within the country situated in Atyrau Pavlodar and Shymkent. These are not capable of processing the total crude output so much of it is exported to Russia. According to the US Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan was producing approximately  of oil per day in 2009.

Kazakhstan also possesses large deposits of phosphorite. One of the largest known being the Karatau basin with 650 million tonnes of P2O5 and Chilisai deposit of Aktyubinsk/Aqtobe phosphorite basin located in north western Kazakhstan with a resource of 500–800 million tonnes of 9% ore.

On 17 October 2013 the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) accepted Kazakhstan as ""EITI Compliant"" meaning that the country has a basic and functional process to ensure the regular disclosure of natural resource revenues.

===Tourism===

Although largest landlocked country in the world Kazakhstan tourism industry is underdeveloped. International arrivals rose from 1.47 million in 2000 to 4.81 million in 2012. Among main tourist attractions there are five World Heritage Sites in Kazakhstan and thirteen are on the tentative list.

===Transport===
The Turkestan-Siberia Railway line connects Central Asia with Russian Siberia

Most cities are connected by railroad; high-speed trains go from Almaty (the southernmost city) to Petropavl (the northernmost city) in about 18 hours.

===Banking===
The banking industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan experienced a pronounced boom and bust cycle over 2000s decade. After several years of rapid expansion in the mid-2000s the banking industry collapsed in 2008. Several large banking groups including BTA Bank J.S.C. and Alliance Bank defaulted soon after. Since then the industry has shrunk and been restructured with system-wide loans dropping to 39% of GDP in 2011 from 59% in 2007. Although the Russian and Kazakh banking systems share several common features there are also some fundamental differences. Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth. Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy this has helped push Kazakhstan’s banking system to a higher level of development. Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia. On the negative side past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual – the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk. The potential is there for serious disturbances if and when authority passes into new hands.

===Green economy===
The government has set the goals that a transition to the Green Economy in Kazakhstan occur by 2050. The green economy is projected to increase GDP by 3% and create more than 500 thousand new jobs.

The government of Kazakhstan has set prices for energy produced from renewable sources. The price of 1 kilowatt-hour for energy produced by wind power plants was set at 22.68 tenge ($0.12). The price for 1 kilowatt-hour produced by small hydro-power plants is 16.71 tenge ($0.09) and from biogas plants 32.23 tenge ($0.18).

===Foreign direct investment===
As of 30 September 2012 foreign investors had placed a total of $177.7 billion in Kazakhstan. According to the US State Department Kazakhstan is widely considered to have the best investment climate in the region. In 2002 the country became the first sovereign in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating from an international credit rating agency. Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a more significant role in the national economy than in most other former Soviet republics.

President Nazarbayev signed into law tax concessions to promote foreign direct investment which include a 10-year exemption from corporation tax an 8-year exemption from property tax and a 10-year freeze on most other taxes. Other incentives include a refund on capital investments of up to 30 percent once a production facility is in operation.

Sir Suma Chakrabarti the President of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) co-chaired the Kazakhstan Foreign Investors’ Council with President Nursultan Nazarbayev. In May 2014 the EBRD and government of Kazakhstan created the Partnership for Re-Energizing the Reform Process in Kazakhstan to work with international financial institutions to channel US$2.7 billion provided by the Kazakh government into important sectors of Kazakhstan’s economy. The partnership will boost investment and drive forward reforms in the country.

As of May 2014 Kazakhstan attracted $190 billion in gross foreign investments since its independence in 1991 and it leads the CIS countries in terms of FDI attracted per capita. One of the factors that attract foreign direct investments is country's political stability. According to the World Bank's report Kazakhstan is among the top 40% of countries in the world that are considered the most politically stable and free of violence.

Kazakhstan also received high ratings in a survey conducted by Ernst & Young in 2014. According to EY's 2014 Kazakhstan Attractiveness Survey ""Investor confidence in Kazakhstan’s potential is also at an all-time high with 47.3% of respondents expecting Kazakhstan to become increasingly attractive over the next three years."" The high level of economic political and social stability and Kazakhstan’s competitive corporate tax rate were the primary reasons mentioned for its attractiveness.

===Bond market===
In October 2014 Kazakhstan introduced its first overseas dollar bonds in 14 years. Kazakhstan issued $2.5 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds on 5 October 2014 in what was the nation’s first dollar-denominated overseas sale since 2000. Kazakhstan sold $1.5 billion of 10-year dollar bonds to yield 1.5 percentage points above midswaps and $1 billion of 30-year debt at 2 percentage points over midswaps. The country drew bids for $11 billion.

===Economic competitiveness===
Kazakhstan achieved its goal of entering the top 50 most competitive countries in 2013 and has maintained its position in the 2014–2015 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report that was published at the beginning of September 2014. Kazakhstan is ahead of other states in the CIS in almost all of the report’s pillars of competitiveness including institutions infrastructure macroeconomic environment higher education and training goods market efficiency labour market development financial market development technological readiness market size business sophistication and innovation lagging behind only in the category of health and primary education. The Global Competitiveness Index gives a score from 1 to 7 in each of these pillars and Kazakhstan earned an overall score of 4.4.

===Housing market===
The housing market of Kazakhstan has grown since 2010. In 2013 the total housing area in Kazakhstan amounted to . The housing stock rose over the year to 32.7 million squares which is nearly an 11% increase. Between 2012 and 2013 the living area per Kazakh citizen rose from . The urban areas concentrate 62.5 percent of the country’s housing stock. 
The UN’s recommended standard for housing stands at  per person. Kazakhstan will be able to reach the UN standards by 2019 or 2020 if in the medium term the housing growth rate remains within 7 percent.

===""Nurly Zhol"" economic policy===
On 11 November 2014 President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev delivered an unexpected state-of-the-nation address in Astana at an extended session of the Political Council of the Nur Otan party introducing a ""Nurly Zhol"" (Bright Path) a new economic policy that implies massive state investment in infrastructure over the next several years. The ""Nurly Zhol"" policy is accepted as preventive measures needed to help steer the economy towards sustainable growth in the context of the modern global economic and geopolitical challenges such as the 25%-reduction in the oil price reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia over Ukraine etc. The policy embraces all aspects of economic growth including finances industry and social welfare but especially esemphasises investments into the development of infrastructure and construction works. Given recent decreases in revenues from the export of raw materials funds will be used from Kazakhstan’s National Fund.

===Corruption===
In 2005 the World Bank listed Kazakhstan as a corruption hotspot on a par with Angola Bolivia Kenya Libya and Pakistan. In 2012 Kazakhstan ranked low in an index of the least corrupt countries and the World Economic Forum listed corruption as the biggest problem in doing business in the country.

In 2011 Switzerland confiscated US$48 million in Kazakh assets from Swiss bank accounts as a result of a bribery investigation in the United States. US officials believed the funds represented bribes paid by American officials to Kazakh officials in exchange for oil or prospecting rights in Kazakhstan. Proceedings eventually involved US$84 million in the USA and another US$60 million in Switzerland

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kazakh Anti-Corruption Agency signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in February 2015.

On 4 December 1981 Ciskei was granted nominal independence from South Africa and became a Bantustan with Lennox Sebe as president.

In 1983 Sebe's brother Lieutenant General Charles Sebe head of Ciskei's intelligence service attempted a coup. He was arrested but later in 1986 he escaped from prison and made his way to nearby Transkei. Charles in 1987 orchestrated the kidnapping of Lennox Sebe's son Kwame.

During this time Colonel Oupa Gqozo was sent to Pretoria as military attaché. He became a brigadier on 1 April 1988. Brigadier Gqozo returned to Ciskei as Chief of Staff Intelligence during December 1989. In January 1990 Gqozo completed his term of duty and was honoured with the Order of Good Hope. 

On 4 March 1990 he staged his own coup in Ciskei in the absence of Lennox Sebe who was on state visit to Hong Kong. Kwame Sebe was also planning to stage a coup but failed to get it off the ground and was kept in military custody together with other government officials. In November of the same year another coup planned by Colonel Guzana and former military council member Major Peter Howsa was stopped. Again in February 1991 another coup was attempted this time by the head of Ciskei's Defence Force Brigadier Aaron Jamangile.

In mid-1991 Gqozo formed the African Democratic Movement to counter the influence of the African National Congress in the region. In December of that year he formed part of the delegation at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) to discuss South Africa's new political dispensation. In March 1992 Gqozo accused the African National Congress of planning to remove him from power in Ciskei.

591054,Cry to Heaven,Plot,"Set in eighteenth-century Italy ''Cry to Heaven'' focuses on two characters peasant-born Guido Maffeo who is castrated at the age of six to preserve his soprano voice and fifteen-year-old Tonio Treschi the last son of a noble family from the Republic of Venice whose father Andrea is a member of the Council of Three of ''La Serenissima''. Although Guido becomes a star of the opera as a teenager he loses his voice at eighteen as many castrati did. After a failed suicide attempt he becomes a music teacher in the Naples conservatorio. Tonio on the other hand learns that his older brother Carlo was exiled for embarrassing the family. Although Andrea attempts to cut Carlo out of the family Carlo returns after Andrea's death and plots to regain his original position. Revealing that Tonio is actually his illegitimate son he has Tonio castrated and sends him off with Guido to study in Naples.

Although everyone in Venice is inclined to believe that Carlo was behind his castration Tonio cannot accuse him of the crime because doing so would result in the extinction of the Treschi family. After some soul-searching he decides to remain in Naples and study under Guido holding off on revenge until after Carlo and his mother (also Carlo's lover and later wife) have children to ensure the family line.

By the power of Tonio's almost inhuman soprano voice Guido is roused from his depression and takes him as a star student. Tonio progresses in his lessons extremely quickly. Guido also has Tonio perform some of his original compositions which begin to impress audiences at the ''conservatorio''.

Tonio for his part struggles to come to terms with his castrato status; in his own mind he is ""less than a man"". At first he finds it difficult even to associate with his fellow castrati. As time goes on he has a love affair with another castrati boy Domenico and after Domenico leaves with Guido himself. He comes to dominate the ''conservatorio''—in addition to being a star student he soon befriends all the boys his age and becomes something of a leader and confidant.

Tonio also continues his studies in fencing and firearms which in Guido's words make him into a ""hero"" to his fellow students especially after in self-defense he kills a student who vowed to kill him. As he was raised to be a gentleman and because he was castrated relatively late in life he continues to act like a man unlike the more effeminate poses of castrati boys. Despite the fact he is a castrato even local noblemen come to respect him both as a sparring partner and as a friend.

However Guido and others need to scheme to get Tonio finally out of the conservatorio and onto the stage. After his debut Guido and Tonio travel to Rome for his operatic premiere. There he gains the patronage of a powerful cardinal Calvino and befriends a powerful count from Florence di Stefano. Although he is almost booed off the stage for upstaging the operatic star Bettichino he proves a great success and both he and Guido have a bright futures in front of themselves. Tonio even becomes lovers with an English noblewoman and widow Christina seemingly restoring him to his former status.

Nonetheless Tonio is unable to break free of the desire for revenge against Carlo. After having two children by Carlo Tonio's mother Marianna dies. Soon afterwards—and before his Mardi Gras opera performance—hitmen sent by Carlo try to kill him. Against the wishes of all his friends Tonio vows to return in time for an Easter opera then disappears.

In Venice Carlo has become a pathetic alcoholic wreck. Disguised as a woman (a trick he learned for the opera) Tonio succeeds in ""seducing"" his father and capturing him. Intoxicated Carlo not only curses ever coming back to Venice but also wants to take Tonio's place finding the city decadent and confining. Although he promises never to try and hurt Tonio again he attempts to kill him the second he has the opportunity. In response Tonio finally kills Carlo. He then returns to his friends at last able to fully pursue his life.

273,Adelaide,Geography,"Satellite image of Adelaide's metropolitan area. The Adelaide Hills is the green area to the right of the image.
City map of Adelaide Australia.

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches  from the coast to the foothills and  from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia an Australian government planning initiative the ""Adelaide Metropolitan Region"" has a total land area of  while a more expansive definition by the Australia Bureau of Statistics defines a ""Greater Adelaide"" statistical area totalling .  The city sits at an average elevation of  above sea level.  Mount Lofty east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of  is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of Burra.

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement with some variation – sandhills swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and Onkaparinga catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the Happy Valley Reservoir supplying around 40% and the much larger Mount Bold Reservoir 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

Adelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40 am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date with the epicentre 12 km from the city centre at Darlington and a reported magnitude of 5.6. There have been smaller earthquakes in 2010 2011 and 2014.

=== Urban layout ===

North Terrace (right) and Pulteney Street (left) looking south-west from Bonython Hall.

Adelaide is a planned city designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia Colonel William Light. His plan now known as '''Light's Vision''' arranged Adelaide in a grid with five squares in the Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks known as the Adelaide Parklands surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers as well as South Australia's first governor John Hindmarsh due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide and the lack of fresh water there. Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of ring roads in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The inner ring route (A21) borders the parklands and the outer route (A3/A13/A16/A17) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) Grand Junction Road Hampstead Road Ascot Avenue Portrush Road Cross Road and South Road.

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and ""country towns"" as well as the satellite city of Elizabeth have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the South Eastern Freeway to cope with growth which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly the booming development in Adelaide's South led to the construction of the Southern Expressway.

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The O-Bahn Busway is an example of a unique solution to Tea Tree Gully's transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of Golden Grove in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.

In the 1960s a Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor government elected under Don Dunstan shelved the plan but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980 the Liberal party won government and premier David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan ensuring that even when needs changed the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway) while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008 the SA Government announced plans for a network of transport-oriented developments across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a 10 hectare industrial site at Bowden for $52.5 million as the first of these developments. The site covers 102478 square metres or about 10 hectares and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south the Adelaide to Outer Harbour railway line to the west Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east.

==== Housing ====


Historically Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on  blocks. A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry as well as the use of stone for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone 15% of timber and 10% of brick with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins door and window surrounds and chimneys and fireplaces.

There is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick and to a lesser degree stone and/or stone-faced single-storey detached houses. After both of the World Wars the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s cream bricks became popular and in the 1970s deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s the majority of houses were of ""double brick"" construction on concrete footings with timber floors laid on joists supported by ""dwarf walls"". Due to Adelaide's reactive soils (particularly Keswick Clay black earth and some red-brown earth soils) since then houses have mainly been constructed of ""brick veneer"" over a timber frame (and more recently over a steel frame) on a concrete raft slab foundation. The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased. In addition to this a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the South Australian Housing Trust.

=== Climate ===


Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification ''Csa'') with warm to hot dry summers and mild short winters with most precipitation falling in the winter months. Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid Köppen's BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year averaging around 80 mm. Frosts are occasional with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city—it experiences wind chill in winter which makes the temperature seem colder than it actually is. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at Mount Lofty occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from .

The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from  in August to  in February.

===Early history===
The fuel for the creation of New Times was provided by opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War and specifically President Richard Nixon's decision in the spring of 1970 to expand the war and launch an invasion of Cambodia. The spark came from the shooting deaths of four students at Kent State University by National Guardsmen. College campuses across the country erupted into demonstrations and strikes including Arizona State University in Tempe.

The state's dominant newspaper the Arizona Republic published an editorial cartoon by Pulitzer Prizewinner Reg Manning. The cartoon showed ""a dirty longhaired young fellow (labeled ""campus terrorist"") draped in vines with a torch in one (""arson"") and a knife (""deadly assault"") in the other. The caption: ""Hang ivy on me and call me a student"" 

The cartoon angered Michael Lacey the Binghamton New York-born son of a sailor turned New York City construction worker. Although his father was not college educated Lacey later recalled he had insisted that his son read the daily New York Journal-American every day a habit that bred a lifelong interest in journalism. Lacey had attended Catholic schools in Newark before moving west to attend ASU. He had already dropped out of school when he and a pair of students Frank Fiore and Karen Lofgren felt compelled to accurately report upon the campus anti-war protests which they believed were either being ignored or misrepresented by the ultra-conservative local media led by the Republic. They planned to publish their own paper which after missing its own first deadline made its debut on June 9 1970 as the Arizona Times.

Rechristened New Times the paper began weekly publication in September 1970. It was neither a hard-core underground publication nor a mainstream journalistic enterprise. It began to develop a unique identity like a number of other post-underground papers around the country. Over the next two years New Times explored a variety of social and political issues both local and national. Revenues crept up and small successes became beacons of hope. In April 1972 the paper attracted J.C Penney which ran a series of full-page advertisements.

In that same summer Phoenix native Jim Larkin joined the paper. Part of a blue-collar family that had deep roots in the desert metropolis Larkin had grown up reading many of the same magazines as Lacey whose attention he got by sending New Times a detailed written analysis of the city's political and media scene. A fellow college dropout who had attended school in Mexico before returning home Larkin quickly became the paper's business and sales leader injecting some practical thinking into its operations.

""The paper survived because there were so many people willing to work for nothing or next to nothing because they had a common vision: all that Sixties and early-Seventies bullshit"" Larkin later recalled. ""The anti-war movement was valid certainly but there were certain elements of the hippie movement that the paper took advantage of. People would work for nothing because they thought they were part of a great social experiment.""

Larkin took a more level-headed approach in part because he had something few of the other New Times staffers did – a spouse and two children to support. After working all day at the paper ""he would drive to the Nantucket Lobster Trap where he worked all night as a waiter.""   In 1974 Larkin was named publisher and president of the company a move that presaged his future role as CEO of the largest group of alternative newsweeklies in America.

But in the early days New Times was not an organization upon which a major newspaper group could be built. The company which had incorporated as New Times Inc. in October 1971 was internally organized as a collective mirroring the thinking of a large number of its underground predecessors. This resulted in long bouts of introspection analysis and debate.

In 1972 the company launched a Tucson edition. It never gained traction for a variety of reasons including cultural differences between the two Arizona cities a lack of advertising interest and an editorial emphasis on Phoenix politics and issues.  The Tucson edition was shuttered in 1975 but not before launching the writing career of Ron Shelton a former minor-league ballplayer who would go on to write and direct the baseball classic Bull Durham.

In July 1973 the company in desperate need of capital ginned up a public stock offering for Arizona residents. The offering raised $38000 with stock priced at $1 per share. The money was spent in no time leaving the company in much the same precarious financial position it was in prior to the sale – only now with more than 200 individual shareholders.

By 1975 many of the paper's staffers had begun to leave the company.  Low pay and the collective nature of the organization had taken its toll. Lacey left in 1974 followed by Larkin in 1975.

Larkin was replaced by Phillip Adams a shareholder and board member who was also a certified public accountant. Adams and his business partner Al Senia also owned the Casa Loma apartments in downtown Tempe where they headquartered the New Times.

But the Adams era was short-lived. Complaints came from stockholders: A lack of communication from management a failure to hold any Board of Directors meetings for more than a year a loss of focus on local issues. This led the previous leaders of the company including Lacey and Larkin to devise a plan to take the newspaper back.

On March 19 1977 the former leaders staged what came to be known as ""the coup.""  After Adams was voted out by supportive shareholders they loaded up all of New Times’ meager office equipment and supplies from the Tempe offices and transported them to a new location at the Westward Ho Hotel in downtown Phoenix.   There the modern New Times company was reborn.

Litigation ensued but within a few months the new management group had prevailed. Larkin became the publisher/president and Lacey joined him as editor soon thereafter.

With circulation now at a low point of 17000 the new managers knew they faced an uphill struggle. Luck was with them. Investigative Reporters & Editors (""IRE"") was about to release a massive report entitled the ""Arizona Project"" that detailed the events surrounding the 1975 murder of Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles. But the Republic refused to publish the report claiming it was unfair and improperly investigated. The Bolles murder was a major story in Arizona. The refusal by the Republic meant the residents of Maricopa County would have no place to read the report.
Except that is in the newly re-formed New Times. For weeks the paper ran installments of the IRE investigation. Papers flew off the stands and the paper established a readership foothold in the Valley of the Sun.
The IRE report was far from the last time New Times would clash with the Republic. In 1980 the daily and its publisher Duke Tully sued New Times for libel claiming its coverage of a union dispute at the Republic was inaccurate. While the suit was eventually dismissed the enmity between the two publications grew.   Ultimately Tully was forced to resign as publisher of the Republic after it was revealed that he had falsified his claims that he had served as an Air Force fighter pilot in Korea and Vietnam. In fact he had not served in Korea or Vietnam and had never been in the military at all.

Fights with the Republic aside one of the first important initiatives for New Times was to increase circulation. The paper was circulated free at locations chosen to attract the young readers coveted by advertisers. The Chicago Reader had pioneered free circulation in the early 1970s and Larkin eagerly embraced the concept. By 1984 weekly circulation reached 140000.   The paper also expanded its coverage beyond news and feature stories to include extensive listings as well as music food film and arts coverage that gave it a much wider appeal.
With Lacey's stewardship of the paper's journalistic content steaming ahead he and Larkin seeded the company with key personnel who would form a foundation for future growth. Among the most prominent were:

Bob Boze Bell:  Bell began at New Times in 1978 carrying the title of visuals editor. A talented cartoonist and humorist Bell created the ""Honky Tonk Sue"" comic strip which along with hundreds of other two-page satirical drawings graced the pages of New Times for more than a decade. After a stint as a morning radio personality in the Phoenix area Bell purchased True West magazine in 1999 where he remains as owner and publisher.

Jana Bommersbach: Bommersbach a star reporter for the Arizona Republic was hired in August 1978. In addition to her duties as managing editor of New Times she wrote a weekly column in the paper skewering many of the Phoenix area's sacred cows. In 1989 she was named editor of the paper succeeding Lacey who became executive editor for the growing group of NTI newspapers. In 1982 the Arizona Press Club awarded her the Virg Hill Newsperson of the Year Award. She later wrote the defining book on infamous Arizona trunk murderess Winnie Ruth Judd.

Dewey Webb: Webb joined the paper in late 1978 from the Phoenix Gazette and quickly became renowned for his coverage of the quirky and obscure corners of life and culture in Phoenix. His writing and headline creation skills earned him numerous awards over his twenty-plus years at the paper.

Hal Smith: Smith a marketing student at Arizona State University joined the sales department in 1979. He soon became advertising director and infused the sales and marketing departments with tools and strategies that drove the exponential growth of the company over the following two decades.   Under his leadership revenues grew from $699000 in 1980 to $9.9 million in 1987 an increase of more than 1300 percent.

Scott Spear: Spear the former owner of a chain of record stores joined New Times in 1980 with a mandate to organize the business side of the paper and manage the rapidly growing free-circulation strategy.He later pioneered the NTI voice-personals business and created a freestanding phone company to support it. In later years he was responsible for identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities and was primarily responsible for the creation of a fully operational national trade association for Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN)

Lee Newquist: Newquist was hired directly out of college in 1982 as an assistant to Hal Smith.  He rose to become publisher of Westword in 1985 and in 1992 was named publisher of the Dallas Observer. In addition he handled the duties of executive vice president of operations for the entire company for a number of years. In 2001 he tendered an offer to NTI ownership to purchase the Fort Worth Weekly. He still owns and operates that newspaper.

Christine Brennan: Brennan joined New Times as a paste-up and production person in 1980. After moving into an editing job she went on to oversee coverage in news and arts and help shape the paper's growing reputation as a purveyor of sophisticated cultural criticism. In 1989 she was named managing editor at Westword and in 1993 was named executive managing editor of New Times Media the No. 2 editorial position in the company reporting directly to Lacey. Upon the sale of NT/VVM to Voice Media Group she became the executive editor for that new company.

Deborah Laake: Laake was hired as managing editor and staff writer for the paper in 1982. In 1983 she authored ""Worm Boys"" a short story published in New Times for which she won a special award from the Columbia Journalism School. She is most famous for her book: Secret Ceremonies: A Mormon Woman's Secret Diary of Marriage and Beyond. In 1988 she was named the Arizona Press Club's Journalist of the Year. Laake diedin 2000.

Andy VanDeVoorde. Hired in 1983 directly out of college at the University of Arizona in Tucson VanDeVoorde began his career as New Times’ calendar editor but quickly moved up in the editorial department. He rose to become music editor and later was named a staff writer. In 1995 he succeeded Brennan as managing editor at Westword and in 1998 moved into corporate management as NTI's executive associate editor overseeing writer recruitment and hiring for the company. He has continued in that role at Voice Media Group.

===1980s: growth and early expansion===
With sales now growing at an ever-increasing rate and a redesign completed that converted the paper into a classic tabloid format  Larkin and Lacey began to look toward other opportunities for growth and expansion. Innovative ideas were infused into the company creating an environment that grew revenues as well as the quality and quantity of the paper's editorial content.
The ""Best Of"" concept was first used in Phoenix in 1979. While a few other alternative newspapers(notably the Real Paper in Boston)had dipped their toes into this concept New Times took it to heights previously thought unreachable.
Originally conceived as an insider's guide to the city ""Best Of"" was a once-a-year respite from the regular New Times practice of ""eviscerating people and displaying their entrails""   The first issue totaled 40 pages (a big jump for the fledgling paper at that time). Later editions made that look like child's play. Smith's sales and marketing skills kicked in; thousands of premiums were custom-made and delivered to potential advertisers followed by sales calls enticing them to run ads in the special issue as well as in the weeks before and after its publication. Winners received plaques and winners’ certificates they could proudly display in their businesses. Advertising campaigns heralding the upcoming ""Best Of"" issue were purchased including local radio television and billboards.
It became common for the entire press run of ""Best Of"" issues to disappear from more than 1500 distribution points within 24 hours. By June 1984 ""Best of Phoenix"" was being printed in two sections and totaled 288 pages.

The company installed a ""Best Of"" issue in each publication it acquired from 1983 through 2001 and readers began to identify the phrase ""Best Of"" with those papers so much so that in 1996 New Times chief legal counsel Steve Watkinson proposed acquiring a trademark for the name ""Best of Phoenix"" and the other four papers then owned by NTI. In 1997 the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted these trademarks in Phoenix Denver Miami Dallas and Houston.  Ultimately NTI/VVM registered the ""Best Of"" trademark for 15 of its publications.

The company successfully defended the trademark and fended off attempts by other companies to use the same term. Most notably NTI/VVM won cases in federal court against corporate giants Ticketmaster-Citysearch (then controlled by media mogul Barry Diller)  in 2000 and again in 2012 versus Yelp.

Revenues grew at an ever-increasing rate throughout the decade in Phoenix and later in Denver and Miami.  Phoenix's growth in particular was exponential: Smith's sales and marketing machine transformed the small Phoenix paper of 1979 (about 32 pages on average) to more than 160 pages every week by the middle of the decade. Sales packages were constructed for and sold to advertisers small and large.The largest advertisers were offered extremely low rates in exchange for large volume commitments.  Over time the number of ads in each week's edition rather than gross revenue became the primary benchmark for measuring growth and success.

In addition to the hundreds of display advertisers appearing in the papers every week a classified advertising section began to grow. And unlike the free classifieds that were a mainstay of many alternative papers a large portion of these ads were paid for.  There was strong reader response thanks to the provocative and humorous nature of many of the ads; combined with the publications’ growing circulation this created a vibrant marketplace that was a far cry from the stuffy world of daily newspaper classifieds.

One of the long-standing features in the classifieds of New Times and other alternative papers was the personals section. These often-quirky ads did not allow personal contact information to be included. Readers devoured them and occasionally someone would recognize the writer and attempt to contact them. But there was no direct way for someone to respond to such an ad.

That changed in the autumn of 1983 when New Times introduced a new category in the classified section that immediately followed the personal ads. It was called ""Romance"" and from a business perspective it was love at first sight. ""Romance"" ads were paid for by the word. The advertiser could write a brief description about themselves and the traits they were looking for in a prospective partner. The ad would be assigned a mailbox number. Readers could respond by mailing a written reply to New Times using that mailbox number. The sealed letters would be placed in a pigeonhole (the ""mailbox"") in the New Times office. Once a week all the letters in a mailbox would be gathered up and mailed to the original advertiser.

A large number of alternative newspapers had similar operations. The seeds for what would later become a gigantic ""personals"" industry were sown in these pigeonholes.

In 1983 the New Times company made its first newspaper acquisition: Westword a Denver fortnightly that had been founded by Patricia Calhoun in 1977. Retrieved December 2 2015. Calhoun graduated from Cornell in 1976 and shortly thereafter founded her first paper the Sandpiper in New Jersey. A year later she decided to close up shop and move west to Colorado where Westword was born. New Times purchased the paper from Calhoun and her partners for about $67000. Shortly thereafter the paper began publishing on a weekly basis. Decades of awards accolades and trouble-making later Calhoun remains the paper's editor today.

However the early days in Denver weren’t easy ones for New Times. Westword was acquired at the beginning of the shale oil collapse which had begun exactly one year earlier with ""Black Sunday "" the day Exxon announced it was shutting down its Colony Project a major shale oil production venture on Colorado's Western Slope. Low oil prices prompted other energy companies to follow Exxon's lead and the Colorado economy descended into a severe recession. ""See through"" buildings in what was once a revitalized downtown Denver became the norm.  Thirty- and forty-story skyscrapers constructed in the optimistic heat of the boom were finished just as the collapse happened. They would stand unoccupied for years. It took a number of years for NTI to right the Westword ship; ultimately Westword became one of the twin pillars upon which NTI built its national footprint.

The other pillar Phoenix New Times continued to grow throughout the 1980s. Recognizing the need for more office space the company purchased a historical building near downtown Phoenix the Booker T. Washington Elementary School.  Built in 1926 the school had been the center of the African-American community in Phoenix during decades of segregation first de jure (Arizona was a Jim Crow state) and then after 1954 de facto. NTI re-furbished the historic structure and today it remains the headquarters of the Phoenix New Times.

Despite its outward success NTI had difficulty establishing banking relationships for many years. The alternative newspaper model with no paid circulation no real tangible assets and a decidedly outsiders’ viewpoint of the power structure of Phoenix was not seen in a kind light by banking interests. Finally in the summer of 1987 one banker Gary Driggs decided to take a chance on the small company and NTI was able to establish adequate borrowing and credit capacity allowing it to buy out all of the 200-plus outstanding stockholders who were left from the ill-fated 1973 public offering. Only LarkinLacey and three key managers were left with equity positions after the buyout was completed.

At almost the same time NTI acquired its third newspaper – the Wave a small alternative paper that had begun publishing on Miami Beach in 1986.  The purchase price was less than $100000 but the newly acquired credit line combined with the growing profits at Phoenix New Times allowed Lacey and Larkin to invest $1.4 million to jump-start the paper.

Key to NTI's Miami strategy was Lacey's hiring of Jim Mullin as editor. Mullin had formerly edited the successful San Diego Reader and was living in Central America immersing himself in Latin culture when Lacey called. Mullin went on to lead the paper's journalistic endeavors for almost twenty years and Miami New Times quickly became a journalistic and commercial success.

===1990s: boom times and rapid expansion===
In 1989 a new tool was added to NTI's revenue-generating playbook one that would increase profitability many times over and help fuel rapid expansion in the 1990s.

Pay-per-call applications dated back to as early as 1971. Typically a caller would dial an advertised phone number with a 900 or 976 prefix. The caller would be billed a fixed amount per minute by the phone company. The phone company kept a portion of the revenue with the balance going to the sponsor of the call.  There were many pay-per-call services: sports scores weather forecasts even dating lines. A new twist was added to this mix in the latter part of the 1980s. It was known as Audiotext a relatively simple concept that combined a pay-per-call application with sophisticated answering machine technology (""IVR""). A person would call a 900 number and enter the voice mailbox number of the service or person for whom they wished to leave a message. Much like a voice-mail system in typical office environments the person who owned the mailbox could listen to the recorded message at a later time and respond appropriately.

In 1989 the Boston Phoenix a large alternative newspaper in Boston introduced a variation of this system to the alternative press at the group's annual trade convention. It was an instant hit. Personal ads were a mainstay of almost all the papers. Now readers could respond to print ads by calling a 900 number punching in the appropriate voice mailbox number included in the print ad and leaving a message for the advertiser. The advertiser could then listen to the responses and answer those that interested him or her. In this way electronic matchmaking was born years before most people had heard of the Internet.

The Phoenix proposed to handle all aspects of the operation with the individual papers responsible only for running the advertisements in print each week. The Phoenix and the newspaper would then split the net revenues after the phone company took its cut.

NTI saw even greater opportunity. It purchased its own Audiotext machines and contracted directly with the phone companies eliminating the middleman and eventually even forming its own telephone company to bypass most of the charges.

The results were stunning.

Within two years the NTI papers were generating Audiotext revenue of more than $2 million per year almost all of which translated directly into profit. Within four years that number would rise to more than $4 million annually. From 1990 through 2001 when Internet services became dominant in the electronic dating market Audiotext generated more than $35 million in revenues for NTI.  At one point it accounted for 11 percent of the company's total revenue.

By the middle of 1991 the Phoenix and Denver papers were very profitable and Miami was breaking even. Those facts coupled with the growing revenues from the Audiotext application allowed NTI to embark on a plan to rapidly expand into Top 15 markets across the country. The company enlisted a boutique investment banking firm to assist in constructing this plan.

Larkin also made one more key hire: Jed Brunst joined the company in September 1991 with the title of chief financial officer. Brunst had previously worked for Coopers and Lybrand and later Allied Signal along with gaining some experience in investment banking. His directive was to professionalize the financial operations of the company and prepare it to rapidly expand its footprint via acquisitions.

With expertise in banking relationships and financial transactions now in place NTI's expansion plan proceeded at a rapid pace throughout the 1990s. In late 1991 NTI purchased the Dallas Observerits most expensive acquisition to date estimated at about $3 million. Almost at the same time the smaller of the two daily papers in Dallas the Dallas Times-Herald was acquired by the Belo-owned Dallas Morning News. This allowed the News to drastically increase its advertising rates as it no longer had any significant competition in the daily newspaper market. This left a much wider gap in pricing between the daily behemoth and the Observer which was now the second-largest print publication in town. As in Miami four years earlier when the No. 2 daily ''The Miami News'' was shuttered sales opportunities were greatly increased by this pricing disparity.

Lacey was busy on the editorial side as well. He hired Peter Elkind as the Observer's first editor a respected journalist who became known for co-authoring the bestseller on the Enron scandal: ''The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron''. (2003) Other luminaries who were alumni of the Observer included Skip Bayless who became a nationally known sports broadcaster at ESPN and later at Fox Sports and Laura Miller who followed her stint as an Observer columnist with election to the Dallas City Council and then to mayor of Dallas.

In early 1993 NTI purchased the 80000-circulation Houston Press from real estate developer Niel Morgan and his partner Chris Hearne. Once again good timing and fate intervened. In 1995 the Houston Post the smaller of the two daily papers inHouston was closed with its assets being sold to the larger Hearst-owned paper the Houston Chronicle. Much as in Dallas and Miami a  prime recipient of the orphaned advertising dollars the Chronicle could not consolidate due to its rising prices was the Press.

In 1995 NTI acquired national advertising firm the Ruxton Group from the Chicago Reader. The Reader had formed Ruxton in the early 1980s to sell national advertising for a small number of the largest alternative newsweeklies. These included Phoenix New Times and Westword. Following the purchase of Ruxton NTI set out to rapidly expand the national advertising footprint of its member papers. It also aggressively pursued other alternative papers to package this market for national advertisers who coveted the desirable demographic the alternatives brought to the table. By 2002 Ruxton represented 52 major alternative publications.

Also in 1995 NTI purchased SF Weekly from local publisher Scott Price. Unlike the other markets that NTI had entered the alternative newsweekly businessin the Bay Area was extremely competitive. Leading the pack was the San Francisco Bay Guardian a 30-year-old politically powerful weekly owned and operated by the bombastic Bruce Brugmann. The Guardian's main market area was the city of San Francisco but it also circulated in other areas around the Bay including Oakland Emeryville and Marin County. There were also alternative weeklies in the East BaySan Jose Santa Cruz Napa Valley Palo Alto and Marin County. The two daily papersthe morning San Francisco Chronicle and the evening San Francisco Examiner were both operated under a Joint Operating Agreement as authorized by the Congressionally enacted Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970.

Lacey hired Jack Shafer former editor of the Washington City Paper as editor of the paper. Shafer repositioned the Weekly editorially differentiating it from the crowded alternative weekly field by emphasizing investigative reporting that unlike the Guardian didn’t hew to a predictable leftist line. Shafer later went on to become one of the nation's preeminent media critics penning columns for Slate.com the New York Times Magazine the Washington Post the Columbia Journalism Review and the New Republic. He is currently Politico's senior media writer.

By the end of 2000 the Weekly had sales of more than $10 million and had achieved profitability. That success soon faded as the bursting of the dotcom bubble sent the Weekly and its competitors into a financial tailspin. Papers began to fail and often were sold. In the case of the Weekly and the Guardian litigation over who was at fault for the losses ensued.

One year after acquiring SF Weekly NTI entered the Los Angeles market. As in San Francisco there was much competition with two competing daily papers and multiple alternative newsweeklies including the market-dominant LA Weekly. In an effort to outflank the Weekly NTI purchased two other alts the Los Angeles View and the Los Angeles Reader and combined them into one weekly publication named New Times Los Angeles. The LA venture proved unprofitable throughout its six-year existence and culminated in the sale of the paper to the parent company of LA Weekly as part of a larger transaction in 2002.

In 1997 NTI did something it hadn’t done since Larkin and Lacey launched New Times in Phoenix: start a paper from scratch this time in South Florida. The company felt that the counties of Broward and Palm Beach despite being directly adjacent to Miami-Dade County were demographically and culturally different and could support a different alt-weekly with different content and advertisers. The result was New Times Broward-Palm Beach(NTBPB) and the assumption proved correct. NTBPB became profitable and remained so through most of the first decade of the 2000s.

In 1998 NTI ventured into the Midwest. In the summer Cleveland Scene was acquired from its founder Richard Kabat. The paper had been founded in 1970 as a music publication focused on rock ‘n’ roll. NTI expanded coverage into areas that matched the journalistic model of its other publications: in-depth reporting and investigations event listings food and restaurant reviews and a fully flushed out classified section. New staff was hired including editor Pete Kotz whose broad-shouldered approach fit the brawling working-class ethos of the town.

But Cleveland like San Francisco and Los Angeles had competitive forces in alternative publishing already in place and Scene struggled to make money. This resulted in the 2002 transaction that also involved New Times Los Angeles.

In November 1998 NTI purchased the Riverfront Times of St. Louis from Ray Hartmann (editor and publisher) and his partner Mark Vittert. The RFT had grown into one of the largest alternative weeklies in the U.S. with weekly circulation of 100000 and a healthy annual profit. That success continued under NTI's ownership. As in Cleveland the company pumped money into the publication and substantially increased the size of the editorial staff. Hartmann and Vittert are still active today as co-owners of St. Louis Magazine. Hartmann is also a television personality on the locally produced PBS show ""Donnybrook.""

In 1999 NTI put the last piece of its Midwest strategy in place by purchasing the Pitch in Kansas City Missouri. Founded in 1980 by former record store owner Hal Brody the paper like Cleveland Scene began life as a music publication. Over time Brody expanded its coverage to news food and arts and it achieved a dominant position as Kansas City's premier alternative newsweekly. At the time of its purchase circulation was 100000 and the paper operated at a profit.

In 2000 NTI consolidated its holdings in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area by purchasing the Fort Worth Weekly. Longtime NTI executive Lee Newquist was named the publisher of the paper which had a circulation of 40000. Within a year Newquist struck a deal with Larkin to purchase the paper a sale that was consummated in mid-2001. Newquist remains owner and publisher of the paper today.

In late 2000 NTI expanded its operations in the Bay Area by negotiating the purchase of the East Bay Express in Oakland from its owners the Chicago Reader group and local editor/publisher John Raeside. The transaction closed just months before the attacks of 9/11. At the time of the purchase the paper had a circulation of 64000.

===21st century: 2001 to present===
The late 1990s saw a huge growth spurt for the NTI publications as it did for most of the alternative newsweeklies in the country and print media in general. The end of the recession of the early 1990s coupled with the dawning of the Internet era in the middle of the decade initially brought a bountiful harvest of new revenues. Dotcom advertisers flush with venture capital money were spending liberally in the media. A portion of that went to alternative weeklies including the growing NTI chain. Ads ran in print and online as newspapers including all the NTI publications began launching websites and selling advertising on the sites. NTI launched its first website in 1995 and within a year had sites up for all of its publications.

The bubble however burst in 2000. The stock market took a dive especially in tech stocks. A recession loomed. The year 2000 would prove to be the apex for NTI's revenue growth. What followed over the next decade was a slow bumpy decline. Market forces and the increasing power of the Internet slowly began to erode the strength of the alternative press.

There were brief signs of life. In 2000 Alta Communications of Boston purchased a minority stake in NTI giving the company a much larger war chest to expand its operations. 

Despite the best efforts there were increasing signs that the economic tides had turned. The erosion of market conditions shifted NTI's focus and resources to achieving operational efficiencies. Once known for its generous spending on editorial NTI was forced to run lean and mean.

Expense cuts were made to meet the changing business environment. Publications that were not profitable were carefully scrutinized and a number were sold or shuttered between 2002 and 2011.  On Monday September 10 2001 the day before the 9/11 terror attacks plunged the American economy into an even more vicious tailspin NTI announced the first layoffs in its history.

In 2002 in an effort to stanch the bleeding at its paper in Los Angeles NTI entered into an agreement with Village Voice Media (VVM) a competing chain that published a number of alternative newspapers including the Village Voice LA Weekly and the Cleveland Free Times. VVM would sell the Free Times to NTI and NTI would sell New Times LA to VVM. This resulted in the weaker money-losing paper in each of the two markets being closed by their new owners a reflection of the two companies’ belief that the L.A. and Cleveland markets could simply no longer sustain two competing alt-weeklies. After critics cried foul the U.S. Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation. The investigation resulted in a settlement that required the companies to sell off the assets and titles of the Free Times and NTLA to new potential competitors.

New owners were found for the Free Times and the assets of New Times LA but both publications ultimately failed. LA Weekly and Cleveland Scene continue to publish today.
In a January 23 2003 letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal Lacey responded to a commentary published in the Journal on January 10 regarding the L.A.-Cleveland agreement. He called the decision to sell New Times Los Angeles ""gut-wrenching"" and took exception to his and Larkin having been referred to as ""wealthy monopolist bullies"" in a headline that accompanied the earlier op-ed. ""We weren’t just losing money in Los Angeles"" Lacey wrote. ""We had a failing business that threatened the health of our entire company. And companies that don’t pay attention to the bottom line cannot afford to hire good writers and publish the news.""

The LA-Cleveland deal was not the first time New Times and VVM would cross paths. By the middle of the decade the two chains had clearly established themselves as the big dogs in the alt-weekly world. It seemed inevitable that one or the other would need to assert its dominance and on October 24 2005 NTI announced a deal to acquire VVM creating a chain of 17 weeklies with a combined circulation of 1.8 million In addition to returning the Los Angeles market to the NTI fold via the LA Weekly the deal also added the iconic Village Voice to the company's roster along with Seattle Weekly City Pages in Minneapolis the Nashville Scene and the OC Weekly in Orange County California.

In a provocative interview with New York magazine published shortly after the deal was announced Lacey made it clear he expected the Voice to take on New Times’ fighting spirit. ""As a journalist if you don’t get up in the morning and say ‘fuck you’ to someone why even do it?"" he asked. ""Look a lot of people think I’m a prick. But at least I’m a prick you can understand. I don’t sneak up on you. You can see me coming from a long way away. Like the Russian winter.""

After the deal's completion New Times assumed the Village Voice name officially rebranding itself Village Voice Media Holdings but commonly referred to in the industry as VVM. What began as a tiny weekly paper in Phoenix was now the largest publishing group in the alternative newspaper category of publishing. By this time there were 125 alternative papers in the U.S. and Canada.

Just prior to the VVM deal Larkin installed a new president and chief operating officer to lead the day-to-day business dealings of what was about to become a much larger company. Scott Tobias began his career with New Times in 1993 as a sales representative at Westword. He rose to become advertising director there and in 1999 was named publisher of the company's latest acquisition the Pitch in Kansas City. He returned to Denver in 2001 to become group publisher overseeing a number of the NTI publications. Tobias’ efforts forestalled the steep declines in revenue experienced in the alternative publishing world for a number of years. Ultimately though the Great Recession and the Internet took their toll.

By the early 2000s the Internet particularly the website Craigslist was destroying the classified advertising business in newspapers nationwide. Classified advertising in daily newspapers as well as weekly alternatives suburban papers and community papers was all moving to the free advertising model of Craigslist and other smaller websites. In response to this phenomenon NTI launched a free classified website called backpage.com in 2004. It soon became the second largest online classified site in the U.S.

The site included all the various categories found in newspaper classified sections including those that were unique to and part of the First Amendment-driven traditions of most alternative weeklies. These included personals (including adult oriented personal ads) adult services musicians and ""New Age"" services.

On September 4 2010 in response to pressure from a variety of governmental agencies and NGO's Craigslist removed the adult services category from its U.S.  sites. Backpage.com soon became the highest profile website to include this category although a significant number of other sites (including Craigslist) continued to include adult services ads though not directly labeled as such Backpage was then targeted by the same forces that had pursued Craigslist.

NTI/VVM refused to buckle to this pressure. In reaching this position VVM felt that the First Amendment rights implications coupled with the protections given to interactive computer services in section 230 of the 1996 Communications and Decency Act were paramount. Over the next five years Backpage won every legal challenge to its right to continue the adult services category on the Backpage site. Backpage also continued to increase its efforts to root out any illegal activity particularly focusing on the identification of ads that might feature underage victims of human trafficking.

The battle over Backpage wasn’t NTI/VVM's only legal headache. In October 2004 SF Weekly was sued by its longtime rival Bruce Brugmann's San Francisco Bay Guardian for allegedly engaging in a predatory-pricing scheme designed to drive the Guardian out of business. The suit was filed in California state court under a Depression-era statute known as the Unfair Practices Act which makes it illegal to sell a product below cost if it can be proven that the sale was made with the intent to injure a competitor or ""destroy competition."" Brugmann who over the years had made no secret of his wish that Lacey and Larkin would pack their bags and leave town claimed that the Weekly was undercutting him on price and subsidizing the effort with cash infusions from Phoenix.

It took four years for the suit to come before a jury in part because of extensive pre-trial motions arguing such points as whether a law that had been written to prevent Safeway from undercutting mom ‘n’ pop grocery stores on price could realistically be applied to modern-day newspaper advertisements especially when many of those ads now appeared on the Internet. When the case went to trial in 2008 the two publications savaged each other both from the witness stand and in withering daily news reports written by NTI/VVM's Andy VanDeVoorde for the Weekly and his nemesis at the Guardian Brugmann lieutenant Tim Redmond.

Weekly attorneys argued that both the Weekly and the Guardian had declining revenues not because of an illegal pricing conspiracy but because of negative trends that were buffeting the entire American newspaper industry including the rise of free classified advertising websites such as Craigslist and the general flow of readers to the web. However the jury ultimately found in favor of the Guardian and awarded it $6.4 million in damages an amount that ballooned to $15.6 million after partial trebling. After a lengthy and contentious appeals process higher courts upheld the judgment which was later settled for an undisclosed amount.

Not all of NTI/VVM's legal skirmishes had such a grim outcome. One in particular – the arrest of Lacey and Larkin by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for allegedly violating grand-jury secrecy laws harkened back to the VVM founders’ early days bedeviling the power elite of Phoenix. As fate would have it the case also provided a fitting bookend to Lacey's and Larkin's long careers with the company.

After county attorney Andrew Thomas dropped the charges against them Lacey and Larkin sued Arpaio Thomas and special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik for violation of their First Amendment Rights and abuse of power. In 2012 the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals ruled there had been no probable cause for the arrests and that the subpoenas were invalid because despite his claim to the contrary Wilenchik had never actually consulted a grand jury.

In 2013 Maricopa County settled the case with Lacey and Larkin paying them $3.75 million. Subsequently Lacey and Larkin used the money from the settlement to establish the Frontera Foundation to assist the Hispanic community of Phoenix. Arpaio had frequently been accused by New Times and others of racial profiling and unfairly targeting Latinos for detention and arrest. The U.S.Department of Justice investigated the charges and later filed a civil rights lawsuit against Arpaio and Maricopa County. That lawsuit was settled in July 2015 but the settlement did not bring an end to Arpaio's legal troubles. In August 2016 a federal judge in Phoenix asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to file criminal contempt charges against the sheriff for failing to follow the judge's orders in a separate racial-profiling case.

Not long before their court victory over Arpaio Lacey's and Larkin's four-decade adventure in alternative journalism came to an end. In 2012 the VVM owners sold the remaining papers and their affiliated web properties to Tobias and a group of other longtime company executives. Executives for the spinoff holding company Denver-based Voice Media Group (""VMG"") raised ""some money from private investors"" in order to separate the newspapers.

In December 2014  NTI/VVM which had held onto Backpage.com after selling the papers to VMG sold its interest in Backpage to a Dutch holding company.

Argentina in order to assert its claim over the South Sandwich Islands established the summer station ''Teniente Esquivel'' at Ferguson Bay on the southeastern coast on January 25 1955. The station had to be evacuated in January 1956 because of volcanic eruption of Mount Holdgate (so named in 1964) on the neighboring Cook Island to the east. In 1976 it established a military base on Thule Island called Corbeta Uruguay (Port Faraday) in the lee (southern east coast) of the island. The British discovered the presence of the Argentine base the same year but chose to pursue a diplomatic solution to the issue until 1982. The base was occupied by British forces in the aftermath of the Falklands War and eventually destroyed in 1982.

383810,Xerox murders,Uyesugi,"Born in Honolulu in 1959 Byran Koji Uyesugi grew up in the Nuuanu neighborhood. While attending Roosevelt High School Uyesugi was a member of the school's Army JROTC chapter and the school's rifle team. Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same.  

Uyesugi had been employed by Xerox as a technician since 1984. Among his hobbies was raising and breeding goldfish and ''koi'' which he would sell to local pet stores. He had an extensive collection of firearms. At the time of the murders he had as many as 25 guns registered in his name dating to 1982. Police also took eleven handguns five rifles and two shotguns from Uyesugi's father.

According to testimony from Uyesugi's father Hiroyuki Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984. In 1988 Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head.

After being transferred to another workgroup Uyesugi began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen. They had difficulty dealing with him. Former co-workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him making him feel isolated and withdrawn.  Uyesugi reportedly made threats against other co-workers' lives. In 1993 he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door. Uyesugi was arrested for third-degree criminal property damage. Co-workers told Dr. Michael Welner chairman of the Forensic Panel and the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial that as early as 1995 Uyesugi was openly talking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he to be fired.  He complained that his co-workers were engaged in patterns of harassment back-stabbing behavior and spreading of rumors.

In the period leading up to the shootings Xerox management had become increasingly committed to phasing out the type of photocopier that Uyesugi serviced. He resisted learning the replacement machine fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine Uyesugi’s manager insisted on November 1 1999 that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with Dr. Michael Welner who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense Uyesugi said he had believed that if he refused to take the training management would fire him. He told Dr. Welner “I decided to give them a reason to fire me.”

415356,Porkhov,History,"One of the fortress' towers

The fortress of Porkhov is believed to have been founded in 1239 by Alexander Nevsky. The timber fortress was sacked by Algirdas (Olgierd) in 1356 and fell in flames in 1387. The Novgorod Republic immediately rebuilt its fortifications in limestone  downstream. In 1428 Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas destroyed the western wall by artillery fire and entered Porkhov. Two years later the Novgorodians augmented the fortress and rebuilt its walls. After the fall of Novgorod to the Muscovites in 1478 the fortress lost its military importance.

Porkhov was the second most important town of Shelon Pyatina after Russa. It was not however a significant economical center—there were only seventy-six homesteads there in the 15th century and almost all of them were peasant ones.

During World War II Porkhov was occupied by German troops from July 11 1941 to February 26 1944 and was a place of a concentration camp.

7854,Boulting brothers,Careers,"Frank Capra (right) confers with Roy Boulting on the editing of the film Tunisian Victory

The brothers constitute one of those producer-director teams responsible for so much notable British cinema. For most of their careers one produced while the other directed but the product remained essentially a 'Boulting Brothers film'. They were socialistically inclined (John fought with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War) but despite a somewhat patrician demeanour they wanted film to have serious connections with social reality.

In 1937 they set up '''Charter Film Productions''' and made several short features including Consider Your Verdict which attracted critical and commercial attention.

Being eager to speak out against the Third Reich the brother’s first major film Pastor Hall (1940) a moving account of a German preacher who refuses to kowtow to the Nazis had to have its initial release delayed by the British Government which was not yet ready to be openly critical of Nazism. Once released the film was well received by the critics and the public.

They followed it up with Thunder Rock (1942) a passionate anti-isolationist allegory distinguished by imaginative cinematography and a theatrical but highly atmospheric lighthouse setting.

In 1941 Roy joined the Army Film Unit where he was responsible for the enormously influential Desert Victory - which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1944 and Burma Victory in 1945. John joined the RAF Film Unit where he made Journey Together in 1945 a dramatised documentary about the training and combat experience of a bomber crew with Richard Attenborough in the lead part.

By the mid-50s they quickly became identified with ""affectionate""  satires on various British institutions such as the army in Private's Progress (1956) diplomacy in Carlton-Browne of the FO (1959) and most famously industry and trade unionism in I'm All Right Jack (also 1959).

The Boulting Brothers worked frequently with both Attenborough and Sellers helping to establish them as leading actors. Attenborough was notably cast as Pinkie in Brighton Rock in (1947) and Sellers as Fred Kite in the hugely successful satirical comedy I’m All Right Jack (1959).

In later years the Boultings directed and produced the northern comedy The Family Way (1966) and the thriller Twisted Nerve (1968) both starring the just-adult Hayley Mills whose first husband Roy subsequently became.

The brothers worked inseparably for their whole career. When John died of cancer in 1985 Roy stopped making films. When the National Film Theatre mounted its biggest retrospective to date of British cinema in the late 1980s Roy who launched it introduced Desert Victory. The Boulting Brother’s films are regarded by film historians as ""a sensitive barometer of the changing times.""

He received his primary education at Harvard Girls’ School Dam Street Colombo post primary education at St. Lorenz’s College Skinner’s Road South (Now Sri Sangaraja Mawatha Maradana) and his secondary education at St. Joseph’s College Colombo. While attending school he attended the Hewavitharana Daham Pasala. He completed his education at St. Joseph’s College during the Le Goc era.

697981,Sexuality of William Shakespeare,Possible attraction to men,"Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton 

Shakespeare's sonnets are cited as evidence of his bisexuality. The poems were initially published perhaps without his approval in 1609. One hundred twenty-six of them appear to be love poems addressed to a young man known as the 'Fair Lord' or 'Fair Youth'; this is often assumed to be the same person as the 'Mr W.H.' to whom the sonnets are dedicated. The identity of this figure (if he is indeed based on a real person) is unclear; the most popular candidates are Shakespeare's patrons Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton and William Herbert 3rd Earl of Pembroke both of whom were considered handsome in their youth.

The only explicit references to sexual acts or physical lust occur in the Dark Lady sonnets which unambiguously state that the poet and the Lady are lovers. Nevertheless there are numerous passages in the sonnets addressed to the Fair Lord that have been read as expressing desire for a younger man. In Sonnet 13 he is called ""dear my love"" and Sonnet 15 announces that the poet is at ""war with Time for love of you."" Sonnet 18 asks ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate"" and in Sonnet 20 the narrator calls the younger man the ""master-mistress of my passion"". The poems refer to sleepless nights anguish and jealousy caused by the youth. In addition there is considerable emphasis on the young man's beauty: in Sonnet 20 the narrator theorises that the youth was originally a woman with whom Mother Nature had fallen in love and to resolve the dilemma of lesbianism added a penis (""pricked thee out for women's pleasure"") an addition the narrator describes as ""to my purpose nothing"". The line can be read literally as a denial of sexual interest. However given the homoerotic tone of the rest of the sonnet it could also be meant to appear disingenuous mimicking the common sentiment of would-be seducers: 'it's ''you'' I want not your body’. In Sonnet 20 the narrator tells the youth to sleep with women but to love only him: ""mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure"".

In some sonnets addressed to the youth such as Sonnet 52 the erotic punning is particularly intense: ""So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide To make some special instant special blest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride."" In Elizabethan bawdy 'pride' is a euphemism for penis especially an erect one.

Others have countered that these passages could be referring to intense platonic friendship rather than sexual love. In the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition (at which time in Britain proven male homosexuality still carried a prison sentence dismissal from the professions and huge public stigma) Douglas Bush writes ""Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship and are likely to leap at the notion of homosexuality (a notion sufficiently refuted by the sonnets themselves) we may remember that such an ideal often exalted above the love of women could exist in real life from Montaigne to Sir Thomas Browne and was conspicuous in Renaissance literature."" Richard Dutton writes that the Shakespearean scholar A. L. Rowse never accepted that the Bard was homosexual to any extent at all writing that ""Shakespeare’s interest in the youth is not at all sexual"". Dutton comments:Rowse’s conviction on this point remained unshaken to his death which is odd not least because he himself was widely understood to be homosexual and wrote openly about writers like Marlowe and Wilde. But Shakespeare for him was always unimpeachably heterosexual.

Another explanation is that the poems are not autobiographical but fiction another of Shakespeare's ""dramatic characterizations"" so that the narrator of the sonnets should not be presumed to be Shakespeare himself.

In 1640 John Benson published a second edition of the sonnets in which he changed most of the pronouns from masculine to feminine so that readers would believe nearly all of the sonnets were addressed to the Dark Lady. Benson's modified version soon became the best-known text and it was not until 1780 that Edmund Malone re-published the sonnets in their original forms.

The question of the sexual orientation of the sonnets' author was openly articulated in 1780 when George Steevens upon reading Shakespeare's description of a young man as his ""master-mistress"" remarked ""it is impossible to read this fulsome panegyrick addressed to a male object without an equal mixture of disgust and indignation"". Other English scholars dismayed at the possibility that their national hero might have been a ""sodomite"" concurred with Samuel Taylor Coleridge's comment around 1800 that Shakespeare's love was ""pure"" and in his sonnets there is ""not even an allusion to that very worst of all possible vices"". Robert Browning writing of Wordsworth's assertion that ""with this key the Sonnets Shakespeare unlocked his heart"" famously replied in his poem ''House'' ""If so the less Shakespeare he!"" The controversy continued in the 20th Century. By 1944 the Variorum edition of the sonnets contained an appendix with the conflicting views of nearly forty commentators. In the year after ""the law in Britain decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting males over twenty-one"" the historian G. P. V. Akrigg published the first extended study of the Earl of Southampton ""who he had no doubt was the 'fair youth' of the sonnets."" Akrigg wrote ""One is forced to suspect that some element of homosexuality lay at the root of the trouble . . . The love which he felt for Southampton may well have been the most intense emotion of his life.""

Literary theorist Stephen Greenblatt in writing about sexuality within Southampton’s world ""assumes that something went on – 'whether they only stared longingly at one another or embraced kissed passionately went to bed together'"".

Stanley Wells also addressed the topic in ''Looking for sex in Shakespeare'' (2004) arguing that a balance had yet to be drawn between the deniers of any possible homoerotic expression in the sonnets and more recent liberal commentators who have ""swung too far in the opposite direction"" and allowed their own sensibilities to influence their understanding. One element that complicates the question of Shakespeare's sexuality is that same-sex friendships in the Renaissance were often characterized by shows of affection (e.g. bed sharing confessions of love) that contemporary readers associate with modern-day sexual relationships.

788753,Howard Miller Clock Company,History,"Howard Miller Clock Company was founded in 1926 as the Herman Miller Clock Company division of office furniture manufacturer Herman Miller specializing in chiming wall and mantle clocks. It was spun off in 1937 and renamed under the leadership of Herman Miller's son Howard C. Miller (1905–1995).  Today there is no connection between the two companies although their headquarters are across the street from one another.

Starting in 1947 the Howard Miller Clock Company produced scores of modern wall clocks and table clocks designed by George Nelson Associates. (At that time Nelson was Director of Design at Herman Miller Furniture Company.) They also produced Nelson's ""Bubble Lighting"" through the late 1970s selling the business in the early 1980s.  (Using the original manufacturing equipment developed by Nelson Associates with Howard Miller the California furniture company Modernica reintroduced the Bubble Lamps in the 1990s and has been the exclusive manufacturer and worldwide distributor of the lamps since that time).  Howard Miller Clock Company also produced other Nelson Associates products; spice cabinets pull-down wall mounted vanities and desks a vertical hanging vinyl strip system  called ""Ribbon Wall"" (which was available in many different variations from 12 inches to 84"" wide and 12"" to 144"" high) a complete line of fireplace tools and other hanging lighting (Metalites Net Lights Bubbles and Lanterns)

A number of Nelson's clocks became icons of the era; the Ball Spike Block Spindle and others were good sellers and have been reissued by Vitra as well as most of the Zoo Timers clocks and a select group of table models.

In the 1960s a line of ceramic wall clocks called ""Meridian"" was produced using ceramic wall plates designed in Italy and using the Nelson clock hands. This line as well as the other Nelson clocks and other pieces was distributed by Richards Morganthau Inc. (also known as Raymor).

One of the last series of modern clocks were the ""Swing Timers"" a group of at least 18 inexpensive all plastic clocks produced in the late 1960s and designed by Arthur Umanoff Associates.  Umanoff also designed Plexiglas floor and wall clocks a series of wood clocks called ""Natural Classics"" and ""Day Timers"" (plastic wall clocks with day and dates).  Nathan George Horwitt designed the ""Museum Clock"" in the 1970' (both wall and table model).  The final George Nelson Associates series of clocks were the 1984 post-modern ""Tempo '21 Series"".

The modern Nelson and Umanoff clocks were discontinued and these days the company has little to no interest in that period of modern design.

Originally the company only made mantel clocks.  Grandfather clocks did not become a part of the product line until the 1960s.

The company began making curio cabinets in 1989.

The company acquired the Hekman and Woodmark companies.

The company began marketing and selling wine and spirits furniture in 2004 thanks to Robert S. LeHocky former Vice President of Sales and Marketing who is the executive vice president due to Phil Miller's retirement in 2008.

The company launched a line of Home Storage Solutions partnering with celebrity Ty Pennington in 2008.
The company launched a line of furniture partnering with Pennington in 2009.

511917,Gretchen am Spinnrade,Analysis,"

Structure: Durchkomponiert.

The song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel thinking of Faust and all that he promises. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning-wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (""Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer""). The first section progresses from D minor to C Major A minor E minor F Major and then ends again with D minor. This plus the gradual crescendo builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F Major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (""Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt...."") The left hand imitation of the treadle disappears and is replaced with block chords giving this section a more free feeling. Additionally the absence of the rhythmic consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust. This section increases tension with a faster tempo louder dynamics and higher pitch in the soprano and peaks at Gretchen's remembrance of Faust's kiss (""Und ach sein Kuß!""). Similar to the previous section the music returns to the home key of D minor as Gretchen resumes reality and begins her spinning once more. The third part begins again with ""Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer"" but this time Gretchen escalates in intensity much faster than the previous sections. However the treadle-like left hand is present keeping her rooted in reality. Gretchen comes down from this fantasy quicker than before as she realizes she and Faust will never be together. With a heavy heart Gretchen comes to terms with this hard truth. The song ends as it began: in D minor alluding to the monotony of the spinning wheel and how reality is always present.

In ""The Collected Reprints from Sing Out! the Folk Song Magazine Volumes 7-12 1964-1973"" (on page 6 preceding the song's notation and lyrics) it is stated that:

“This old ballad has been kept alive over the centuries by both print and oral tradition. Originally an English street ballad (or broadside) the song became particularly popular in the United States by parlor singers and ballad-printers. During the 19th century it was known throughout the country and in time became part of the folk heritage. Its popularity was such that in Kansas local versifiers used the song for a parody:""

 ''Come all you folks of enterprise who feel inclined to roam''
 ''Beyond the Mississippi to seek a pleasant home;'' 
 ''Pray take a pioneer's advice I'll point you out the best -''
 ''I mean the state of Kansas the lily of the West''

Holly Near recorded a parody of the song about the lesbian scene in which the singer a woman was obsessed with ''Lily the flora of the West.''

The traditional Irish tune is a variant of that also commonly used for the folk song The Lakes of Pontchartrain and it belongs to the same Irish melody-family as a song variously known as  On the Trail of the Buffalo / Buffalo Skinners / The Hills of Mexico / The State of Arkansas / Boggus Creek.

46658,Jelle Zijlstra,Introduction,"

'''Jelle Zijlstra''' (; 27 August 1918 – 23 December 2001) was a Dutch politician of the now defunct Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) which merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in 1977. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 22 November 1966 until 5 April 1967.

An economist by occupation he became a professor of Economics at the Vrije Universiteit at the age of thirty in 1948. Zijlstra was asked to become Minister of Economic Affairs after the Dutch general election of 1952 in the second Drees cabinet under Prime Minister Willem Drees of the Labour Party he resigned as a professor the same day he took office as the new Minister of Economic Affairs on 2 September 1952. Zijlstra became the ''lijsttrekker'' (top candidate) of the Anti-Revolutionary Party for the Dutch general election of 1956 and served as party leader from 23 April 1956 to 3 October 1956 and as the parliamentary party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives from 14 June 1956 to 3 October 1956 and a Member of the House of Representatives from 3 July 1956 to 3 October 1956. After a slow cabinet formation the third Drees cabinet was formed and Zijlstra remained Minister of Economic Affairs. The Drees III cabinet fell on 22 December 1958 and a caretaker cabinet was formed by former Prime Minister Louis Beel of the Catholic People's Party. Zijlstra remained as Minister of Economic Affairs and simultaneously served as Minister of Finance in the second Beel cabinet. Zijlstra again became the ''lijsttrekker'' for the Anti-Revolutionary Party during the Dutch general election of 1959 and served as party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party a second time from 29 December 1958 until 26 May 1959. After a quicker formation the new De Quay cabinet was formed on 19 May 1959. Zijlstra remained Minister of Finance under the new Prime Minister Jan de Quay of the Catholic People's Party and served until 14 July 1963 when the Marijnen cabinet was installed.

Zijlstra became a Member of the Senate on 25 June 1963 and returned to the Vrije Universiteit as an associate professor of Public finances. On 14 October 1966 the Cals cabinet the successor of the Marijnen cabinet fell after the party leader of the Catholic People's Party Norbert Schmelzer introduced a motion of no confidence against the cabinet and Prime Minister Jo Cals who was a member of his own party. The Dutch political landscape was fractured and Zijlstra was asked to form a caretaker cabinet of which the primary task was to write out an early general election in 1967. Zijlstra became Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs on 22 November 1966 and resigned as a Member of the Senate. Zijlstra simultaneously served as Minister of Finance leading the Zijlstra cabinet until 5 April 1967 when the De Jong cabinet was installed.

After his premiership Zijlstra retired from active politics at the age of forty-eight and became the President of ''De Nederlandsche Bank'' the central bank of the Netherlands serving from 1 May 1967 until 1 January 1982. He had already been appointed as President of the bank on 16 September 1966 but his unexpected premiership delayed this. Zijlstra also occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world. Zijlstra was widely respected for his expertise and integrity and was a godparent of King Willem-Alexander. On 30 April 1983 he was granted the honorary title of Minister of State which he held until his death.

289956,Plate reader,Fluorescence polarization,"Fluorescence polarization measurement is also very close to FI detection. The difference is that the optical system includes polarizing filters on the light path: the samples in the microplate are excited using polarized light (instead of non-polarized light in FI and TRF modes). Depending on the mobility of the fluorescent molecules found in the wells the light emitted will either be polarized or not. For example large molecules (e.g. proteins) in solution which rotate relatively slowly because of their size will emit polarized light when excited with polarized light. On the other hand the fast rotation of smaller molecules will result in a depolarization of the signal. The emission system of the plate reader uses polarizing filters to analyze the polarity of the emitted light. A low level of polarization indicates that small fluorescent molecules move freely in the sample. A high level of polarization indicates that fluorescent is attached to a larger molecular complex. As a result one of the basic applications of FP detection is molecular binding assays since they allow to detect if a small fluorescent molecule binds (or not) to a larger non-fluorescent molecule: binding results in a slower rotation speed of the fluorescent molecule and in an increase in the polarization of the signal.

186601,Limit cycle,Stable unstable and semi-stable limit cycles,"In the case where all the neighbouring trajectories approach the limit cycle as time approaches infinity it is called a ''stable'' or ''attractive'' limit cycle (ω-limit cycle). If instead all neighbouring trajectories approach it as time approaches negative infinity then it is an ''unstable'' limit cycle (α-limit cycle). If there is a neighbouring trajectory which spirals into the limit cycle as time approaches infinity and another one which spirals into it as time approaches negative infinity then it is a ''semi-stable'' limit cycle. There are also limit cycles which are neither stable unstable nor semi-stable: for instance a neighboring trajectory may approach the limit cycle from the outside but the inside of the limit cycle is approached by a family of other cycles (which wouldn't be limit cycles).

Stable limit cycles are examples of attractors. They imply self-sustained oscillations: the closed trajectory describes perfect periodic behavior of the system and any small perturbation from this closed trajectory causes the system to return to it making the system stick to the limit cycle.

324749,Bob Boyd (baseball),Career,"Nicknamed ""Rope"" for his line-drive hitting Boyd played in the Negro Leagues with the Memphis Red Sox (1947–49) and in the major leagues for the Chicago White Sox (1951 1953–54) Baltimore Orioles (1956–60) Kansas City Athletics (1961) and Milwaukee Braves (1961).

Boyd threw and batted left-handed and he could shine with his glove. He was a contact hitter slight of frame and didn't produce the kind of home run power expected from a major league first baseman. He started his professional career in the Negro Leagues with the Memphis Red Sox and played three seasons for them between 1947 and 1949 batting .352 .369 and .371 respectively.

In 1950 Boyd became the first black player to sign with the Chicago White Sox. He made his debut on September 8 1951. Basically a backup player and pinch-hitter with the Sox in 1954 he was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals but didn't play for them. Boyd was out in 1955 and at the end of the season he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles from St. Louis in the 1955 rule 5 draft. In 1956 with the Orioles he hit .311 with two homers and 11 RBI in 70 games.

Boyd enjoyed a career season in 1957. Only eight batters reached the .300 mark in the American League and he finished fourth in the batting race with a .318 average behind Ted Williams (.388) Mickey Mantle (.365) and Gene Woodling (.321) and over Nellie Fox Minnie Miñoso Bill Skowron and Roy Sievers. Beside this Boyd became the first Oriole regular in the 20th century to hit over .300 in batting average. The following year he batted .309 with a career-high seven home runs.

Boyd ended his majors career in 1961. He compiled a .293 batting average with 19 home runs and 175 RBI in 693 games. Thanks to his discipline at the plate and knowledge of the strike zone he registered an outstanding 1.465 walk-to-strikeout ratio (167-to-114). At first base he committed only 36 errors in 4159 chances for a .991 fielding average.

Bob Boyd died at age 84 in Wichita Kansas. He is a member both of the Negro League Hall of Fame and of the National Baseball Congress Hall of Fame.

When all of the glass pieces have been put within came and a border put around the entire work pieces are cemented and supported as needed. The work may be made waterproof by forcing a soft oily cement or mastic between the glass and the cames. A form of embellishment and gilding such as Angel gilding and Eglomise may be added to finish the piece.

732093,Mahi Kantha Agency,History,"The states came within the British sphere of influence after the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805. In 1811 when the Maratha power was declining the British Government stipulated to collect and pay over to the ruler of Baroda the yearly tribute of the Mahi Kantha states. In 1820 they finally took over the management of the whole territory agreeing to collect and pay over the tribute free of expense to Baroda while Baroda was pledged not to send troops into the country or in any way to interfere with the administration. After a few disturbances in the 1830s in 1857-8 and 1867 peace remained unbroken in the region until 1881 when the Bhils of Pol rose against their chief and extorted from him a settlement of their claims.

The famine of 1899–1900 was severely felt in Mahi Kantha and the population of the agency decreased by 38% in the decade 1891–1901 due to famine. Many of the inhabitants were Bhils and Kolis. In 1897 a metre-gauge railway was opened from Ahmedabad through Parantij near Ambliara State to Ahmednagar. At Sadra was the Scott College for the education of the sons of rulers on the lines of a British public school. There were also English language schools at Sadra Idar and Mansa.

395375,Anne Charleston,''Neighbours'',"In 1986 Charleston was cast as Madge Mitchell in the Australian soap opera ''Neighbours''. Madge was a new character added to the series when it switched to Network Ten. The series became popular in Australia and the United Kingdom in the years following. Through the series Charleston became internationally recognised and won a Penguin Award in 1987 for Best Actress.

In 1992 Charleston left the series and emigrated to the Republic of Ireland. Four years later she accepted the offer to return to ''Neighbours'' reprising the role from 1996. In her second stint in the series Charleston observed that Madge had been transformed from being bold and fiery to a more meek and passive character a change that led to her ultimate decision to leave the series in 2000. Her final episode was broadcast in Australia during April 2001. She returned to ''Neighbours'' in 2015 alongside co-star Ian Smith to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the serial. Charleston also appeared in a documentary celebrating the anniversary titled ''Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite'' which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.

525816,Lucas Industries,Acquisitions And Agreements,"Lucas also acquired many of its British competitors:

===CAV===
CAV Ltd was headquartered in Acton London making diesel fuel injection equipment for diesel engine manufacturers worldwide and electrical equipment for commercial and military vehicles.

The company was formed by Charles Anthony Vandervell (1870–1955) making accumulators electric carriage lamps and switchboards in Willesden.

In 1904 the firm moved to Warple Way Acton. The firm pioneered the dynamo-charged battery principle and in 1911 it produced the world's first lighting system used on a double-decker bus. By 1918 1000 employees were making vehicle electrics and aircraft magnetos. Wireless components were also made from 1923.

In 1926 CAV was bought by Lucas. In 1931 CAV in partnership with Robert Bosch Ltd. became CAV-Bosch Ltd and began making fuel injection pumps for the diesel industry and later fuel systems for aircraft. Lucas bought Bosch's interest out in 1937 and it became CAV Ltd in 1939. In 1978 the company's name became Lucas CAV. In 1980 the Acton factory employed around 3000 people making heavy duty electric equipment for commercial vehicles by this time high volume diesel fuel injection manufacturing had been relocated to larger modern factories in Kent Suffolk Gloucestershire and many countries throughout the world. Acton continued to make low volume specialist pumps for the military and for Gardner engines.

The electrical business was sold to US company Prestolite Electric in 1998 and remained at Acton until relocating to nearby Greenford in 2005.

The diesel fuel injection equipment research engineering and manufacturing business known in later years as Lucas Diesel Systems Ltd continues at all of the worldwide sites (with the exception of those in Japan and South Carolina US which had closed by this time) and since 2000 has been owned by Delphi a US-domiciled automotive parts and systems manufacturer. The name has been changed to Delphi and the business is a major part of the Delphi Powertrain Division.

Worldwide dieselfuel injection business sites: England - Gillingham Kent; Park Royal London; Sudbury Suffolk; Stonehouse Gloucestershire. France - Blois and La Rochelle. Brazil - São Paulo. Mexico - Saltillo. Spain - Sant Cugat Barcelona. Turkey - Ismir. India - Mannure Chennai. Korea - Changwon Busan.

===Girling===
The company started as a car brake manufacturer after in 1925 Albert H. Girling (also co-founder of Franks-Girling Universal Postage) patented a wedge-actuated braking system. In 1929 he sold the patent rights to the New Hudson company. Girling later developed disc brakes which were successful on racing cars from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Girling brakes had the quirk of using natural rubber (later nitrile) seals which caused difficulties for some American owners of British cars because of incompatibility with US brake fluids.

Girling brake manufacture was taken over by Lucas in 1938 but the patent remained held by New Hudson until this in turn was purchased by Lucas in 1943. Lucas then moved its Bendix brake and Luvax shock absorber interests into a new division which became '''Girling Ltd'''.  Girling  products included:
*Brake systems.
*Clutch systems
*Shock absorbers
*Hydraulic dampers  A short lived Luvax/Girling cooperation that moderated up and down leaf spring movement by turning that motion into a horizontal back and forth motion from center.  The damper hydraulically moderates equally both upward and downward motion of the wheels.  In this sense they are quite different from shock absorbers which mainly moderate upward movement of the wheel.  Such dampers were used for a few years on light-weight British post-war cars such as MG and Austin. 

===Rotax===


Rotax went through several name changes and manufacturing locations the last of these being the former premises of the Edison Phonograph Company in Willesden west London in 1913. Initially a motor cycle accessory business Rotax began to specialise in aircraft components after the First World War. After an initial proposal for Lucas and Rotax to jointly take over CAV Lucas decided in 1926 to take over both companies.

In 1956 Lucas Rotax opened a new plant in the new town of Hemel Hempstead to the north of London. Lucas Rotax was later renamed Lucas Aerospace. By the 1970s the company had 15 plants at various locations.


===Aerospace===
Based in the Park Royal Industrial Estate London next to a soy sauce factory and opposite Lucas Rotax this facility provided components for BAE Systems principally for the Stingray Torpedo Project.

===Simms===
In 1913 Frederick Richard Simms started Simms Motor Units Ltd which in the First World War became the principal supplier of magnetos to the armed forces. In 1920 the company took over a former piano factory in East Finchley north London. During the 1930s the factory developed a range of Diesel fuel injectors. In the Second World War the company again became the principal supplier of magnetos for aircraft and tanks also supplying dynamos starter motors lights pumps nozzles spark plugs and coils.

The East Finchley factory continued to expand after the war eventually reaching  and the company took over many other firms. Simms Motor Units was itself taken over by Lucas in 1968 and integrated within the CAV division. Manufacturing in East Finchley was steadily run down and the factory closed in 1991 to be redeveloped for housing. It is commemorated by Simms Gardens and Lucas Gardens.
"
170375,Trial and conviction of Alfred Dreyfus,Germany,"Meanwhile serious complications with Germany were expected. Once assured by Schwartzkoppen as well as the War Office at Berlin that Dreyfus was utterly unknown to them the German government protested publicly against the statements in the newspapers that persisted in bringing Germany into the case. Several times after the arrest of Dreyfus semi-official notes of protest had been inserted in the different organs of the press; Georg Herbert zu Münster the German ambassador denied to Hanotaux that Germany had taken any part in the affair. These declarations although politely received left the French government absolutely skeptical for it knew from a positive source the origin of the bordereau.

On November 30 a note from the Havas Agency put the foreign embassies out of the case but the press continued to incriminate Germany. At the beginning of December Münster by the express order of the German Emperor invited Hanotaux to call at the embassy and repeated his protestations. The report was spread abroad that Germany had demanded and obtained the restoration of the documents that established the traitor's guilt.

Provoked by the persistence of these attacks the German embassy inserted in the ""Figaro"" of 26 December a fresh notice denying formally that it had ""the least intercourse either direct or indirect"" with Dreyfus. As this notice also seemed to have little or no effect the Emperor telegraphed to Münster on 5 January to go personally to Casimir-Perier and say ""If it be proved that the German embassy has never been implicated in the Dreyfus case I hope the government will not hesitate to declare the fact."" Otherwise it was understood that the ambassador would leave Paris. This dispatch communicated by Münster to Charles Dupuy who was then temporarily engaged at the Foreign Office had the appearance of an ultimatum.

Up to this point the president of the republic had known very little of the details of the case and having been kept by Hanotaux in complete ignorance of Münster's previous communications. But now he had the contents of the legal documents shown to him and after reading them he granted Münster the audience that he had requested. Considering honesty to be the best policy he asserted very frankly that the criminal letter had been taken from the German embassy but that it was not an important document and that nothing proved that it had been ""solicited.""

After having referred the matter to Berlin Münster consented to the drawing up of a note by the Havas Agency which once more put all the embassies out of the case and terminated the incident on 9 January 1895. General Auguste Mercier did not long enjoy his triumph. On January 15 under pretext of a ministerial crisis in which his friends abandoned him Casimir-Perier handed in his resignation as president of the republic the mysteries and intrigue of the Dreyfus affair apparently hastening this decision.

At the congress called together to elect a new president printed ballots were passed about putting forth General Mercier as a candidate. One handbill even set him down as the savior of the republic for having had the traitor Dreyfus condemned in spite of all difficulties. However he obtained only three votes. Ribot entrusted by the new president Félix Faure with forming a cabinet did not appeal to an assistant so compromised as Mercier and the office of the minister of war was given to General Zurlinden.
